		<p>Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a<br />survival... a survival of a hugely remote period when...<br />consciousness was manifest, perhaps, in shapes and forms<br />long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing<br />humanity... forms of which poetry and legend alone have<br />caught a flying memory and called them gods, monsters,<br />mythical beings of all sorts and kinds...<br />- ALGERNON BLACKWOOD<br />I. THE HORROR IN CLAY<br />The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability<br />of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We<br />live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas<br />of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.<br />The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have<br />hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together<br />of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas<br />of reality and of our frightful position therein, that we shall<br />either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly<br />light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.<br />Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of<br />the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form<br />transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survival in<br />terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a<br />bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the<br />single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I<br />think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse,<br />like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an<br />accidental piecing together of separated things - in this case<br />an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I<br />hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out;<br />certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so<br />hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to<br />keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would<br />have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.<br />My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-7<br />with the death of my great-uncle, George Gammell Angell,<br />Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages inBrownUniversity<br />Providence,Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely<br />known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had<br />frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent<br />museums so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be<br />recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the<br />obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been<br />stricken whilst returning from theNewportboat; falling<br />suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a<br />nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer<br />dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short<br />cut from the waterfront to the deceased's home in Williams<br />Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder,<br />but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure<br />lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a<br />hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the<br />time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly<br />I am inclined to wonder - and more than wonder.<br />As my great-uncle's heir and executor, for he died a<br />childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with<br />some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set<br />of files and boxes to my quarters inBoston. Much of the<br />material which I correlated will be later published by the<br />American Archaeological Society, but there was one box<br />which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much<br />averse from showing to other eyes. It had been locked, and I<br />did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the<br />personal ring which the professor carried always in his<br />pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but when I<br />did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more<br />closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the<br />queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings<br />and cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter<br />years, become credulous of the most superficial impostures?<br />I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for<br />this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.<br />The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch<br />thick and about five by six inches in area; obviously of<br />modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern<br />in atmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries of<br />cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often<br />reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric<br />writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs<br />seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much<br />familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed<br />in any way to identify this particular species, or even hint at<br />its remotest affiliations.<br />Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of<br />evidently pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution<br />forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be<br />a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form<br />which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my<br />somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous<br />pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I<br />shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,<br />tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with<br />rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole<br />which made it most shockingly frightful. Behind the figure<br />was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural<br />background<br />The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a<br />stack of press cuttings, in Professor Angell's most recent<br />hand; and made no pretension to literary style. What seemed<br />to be the main document was headed 'CTHULHU CULT'<br />in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous<br />reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was<br />divided into two sections, the first of which was headed<br />'1925 - Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas<br />St.,Providence, R. I.,' and the second; 'Narrative of Inspector<br />John R. Legrasse,121 Bienville St.,New Orleans,<br />La., at 1908 A. A, S. Mtg. - Notes on Same, &amp; Prof. Webb's<br />Acct.' The other manuscript papers were all brief notes,<br />some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different<br />persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and<br />magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliott's Atlantis and the Lost<br />Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret<br />societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in<br />such mythological and anthropological source-books as<br />Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's Witch-Cult in<br />Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outr&eacute; mental<br />illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of<br />1925.<br />The first half of the principal manuscript told a very<br />peculiar tale. It appears that on1 March 1925, a thin, dark<br />young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon<br />Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which<br />was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the<br />name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized<br />him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly<br />known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at<br />the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the<br />Fleur-de-LysBuildingnear that institution. Wilcox was a,<br />precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and<br />had from childhood excited attention through the strange<br />stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He<br />called himself 'psychically hypersensitive,' but the staid folk<br />of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely<br />'queer'. Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped<br />gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a<br />small group of aesthetes from other towns. Even theProvidence<br />Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had<br />found him quite hopeless.<br />On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript,<br />the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's<br />archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on<br />the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which<br />suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle<br />showed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous<br />freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but<br />archaeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my<br />uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was<br />of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his<br />whole conversation, and which I have since found highly<br />characteristic of him. He said, 'It is new, indeed, for I made it<br />last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older<br />than broodingTyreor the contemplative Sphinx, or gardengirdledBabylon.'<br />It was then that he began that rambling tale which<br />suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the<br />fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake<br />tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in<br />New Englandfor some years; and Wilcox's imaginations had<br />been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an<br />unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks<br />and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and<br />sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the<br />walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below<br />had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation<br />which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he<br />attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble<br />of letters 'Cthulhu fhtagn'<br />This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which<br />excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the<br />sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost<br />frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found<br />himself working, chilled and clad only in his nightclothes,<br />when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle<br />blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness<br />in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design.<br />Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his<br />visitor especially those which tried to connect the latter with<br />strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand<br />the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in<br />exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread<br />mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor<br />Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed<br />ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his<br />visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore<br />regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript<br />records daily calls of the young man, during which he related<br />startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was<br />always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping<br />stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting<br />monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable<br />save gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated<br />are those rendered by the letters 'Cthulhu' and 'R'lyeh.'<br />On 23 March the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to<br />appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had<br />been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the<br />home of his family inWaterman Street. He had cried out in<br />the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and<br />had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness<br />and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the<br />family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the<br />case; calling often at theThayer Streetoffice of Dr Tobey,<br />whom he learned to be in charge. The youth's febrile mind,<br />apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor<br />shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included<br />not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but<br />touched wildly on a gigantic thing 'miles high' which walked<br />or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object<br />but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr Tobey,<br />convinced the professor that it must be identical with the<br />nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream<br />-sculpture. Reference to this object, the doctor added, was<br />invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into<br />lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly<br />above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as<br />to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.<br />On 2 April at about3 P.M.every trace of Wilcox's malady<br />suddenly ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find<br />himself at home and completely ignorant of what had<br />happened in dream or reality since the night of 22 March.<br />Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his<br />quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no<br />further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had<br />vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of<br />his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant<br />accounts of thoroughly usual visions.<br />Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references<br />to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for<br />thought - so much, in fact, that only the ingrained<br />scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my<br />continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were<br />those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering<br />the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his<br />strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly<br />instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst<br />nearly all the friends whom he could question without<br />impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and<br />the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The<br />reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he<br />must at the very least, have received more responses than<br />any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary.<br />This original correspondence was not preserved but his<br />notes formed a thorough and really significant digest.<br />Average people in society and business -New England's<br />traditional 'salt of the earth' - gave an almost completely<br />negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless<br />nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always<br />between 23 March and 2 April - the period of young Wilcox's<br />delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though<br />four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of<br />strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a<br />dread of something abnormal.<br />It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers<br />came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had<br />they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their<br />original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked<br />leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in<br />corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is<br />why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognizant of<br />old data which my uncle had possessed, had been<br />imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from<br />aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From 28 February to 2 April<br />a large proportion of the dreams being immeasurable the stronger<br />during the period of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of<br />those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds<br />not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and<br />some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic<br />nameless thing visible towards the last. One case, which the<br />note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a<br />widely known architect with leanings towards theosophy<br />and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young<br />Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after<br />incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen<br />of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead<br />of merely by number, I should have attempted some<br />corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I<br />succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however,<br />bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the<br />objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as did<br />this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach<br />them.<br />The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases<br />of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period.<br />Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for<br />the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources<br />scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide<br />inLondon, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window<br />after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the<br />editor of a paper inSouth America, where a fanatic deduces a<br />dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from<br />Californiadescribes a theosophist colony as donning white<br />robes en masse for some 'glorious fulfilment' which never<br />arrives, whilst items fromIndiaspeak guardedly of serious<br />native unrest towards the end of March. Voodoo orgies<br />multiply inHaiti, and African outposts report ominous<br />mutterings. American officers in thePhilippinesfind certain<br />tribes bothersome about this time, andNew Yorkpolicemen<br />are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of 22-23<br />March The west ofIreland, too, is full of wild rumour and<br />legendry and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Boonot<br />hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in theParisspring<br />salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in<br />insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the<br />medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and<br />drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings,<br />all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous<br />rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then<br />convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older<br />matters mentioned by the professor.<br />II. THE TALE OF INSPECTOR LEGRASSE<br />The old matters which had made the sculptor's dream and<br />bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of<br />the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it<br />appears Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of<br />the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown<br />hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can<br />be rendered only as 'Cthulhu'; and all this in so stirring and<br />horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued<br />young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.<br />This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen<br />years before when the American Archaeological Society<br />held its annual meeting inSt Louis. Professor Angell, as<br />befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a<br />prominent part in all the deliberations, and was one of the<br />first to be approached by the several outsiders who took<br />advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct<br />answering and problems for expert solution.<br />The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus<br />of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking<br />middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from<br />New Orleansfor certain special information unobtainable<br />from any local source. His name was John Raymond<br />Legrasse, and he was by profession an inspector of police<br />With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque,<br />repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose<br />origin he was at a loss to determine.<br />It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the<br />least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for<br />enlightenment was prompted by purely professional<br />considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was,<br />had been captured some months before in the wooden<br />swamps south ofNew Orleansduring a raid on a supposed<br />voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites<br />connected with it, that the police could not but realize that<br />they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them,<br />and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the<br />African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic<br />and unbelieveable tales extorted from the captured<br />members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the<br />anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might<br />help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track<br />down the cult to its fountain-head.<br />Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the<br />sensation which his offering created. One sight of the thing<br />had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into<br />a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding<br />around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter<br />strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so<br />potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized<br />school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet<br />centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its<br />dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.<br />The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to<br />man for close and careful study, was between seven and<br />eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.<br />It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline,<br />but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass<br />of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws<br />on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This<br />thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural<br />malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence,<br />and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or<br />pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips<br />of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat<br />occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the<br />doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge<br />and extended a quarter of the way down towards the<br />bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent<br />forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the<br />backs of huge fore-paws which clasped the croucher's<br />elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally<br />lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source was<br />so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable<br />age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it show with<br />any known type of art belonging to civilization's youth - or<br />indeed to any other time.<br />Totally separate and apart, its very material was a<br />mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its<br />golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled<br />nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters<br />along the base were equally baffling; and no member<br />present, despite a representation of half the world's expert<br />learning in this field, could form the least notion of even<br />their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and<br />material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct<br />from mankind as we know it; something frightfully<br />suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our<br />world and our conceptions have no part.<br />And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and<br />confessed defeat at the inspector's problem, there was one<br />man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre<br />familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who<br />presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew.<br />This person was the late William Channing Webb, professor<br />of anthropology inPrincetonUniversity, and an explorer of<br />no slight note.<br />Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before,<br />in a tour ofGreenlandandIcelandin search of some<br />Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst<br />high up on theWest Greenlandcoast had encountered a<br />singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a<br />curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate<br />bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which<br />other Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only<br />with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly<br />ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides<br />nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer<br />hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or<br />tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful<br />phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing<br />the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But<br />just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult<br />had cherished, and around which they danced when the<br />aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor<br />stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous<br />picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell,<br />it was rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial<br />thing now lying before the meeting.<br />These data, received with suspense and astonishment by<br />the assembled members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector<br />Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with<br />questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the<br />swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested, he besought<br />the professor to remember as best he might the syllables<br />taken down amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then<br />followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment<br />of really awed silence when both detective and scientist<br />agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two<br />hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in<br />substance, both the Eskimo wizards and theLouisiana<br />swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something<br />very like this - the word-divisions being guessed at<br />from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud;<br />'Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.'<br />Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for<br />several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him<br />what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This<br />text, as given, ran something like this:<br />'In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.'<br />And now, in response to a general urgent demand, Inspector<br />Legrasse related as fully as possible his experience<br />with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could<br />see my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of<br />the wildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and<br />disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination<br />among such half-castes and pariahs as might be least<br />expected to possess it.<br />On 1 November 1907, there had come to New Orleans<br />police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon<br />country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive<br />but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the<br />grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen<br />upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but<br />voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known;<br />and some of their women and children had disappeared<br />since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant<br />beating far within the black haunted woods where no<br />dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing<br />screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames;<br />and, the frightened messenger added, the people could<br />stand it no more.<br />So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an<br />automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the<br />shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable<br />road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence<br />through the terrible cypress woods where day never came.<br />Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss<br />beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or<br />fragments of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid<br />habitation a depression which every malformed tree and<br />every fungous islet combined to create. At length the<br />squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in<br />sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the<br />group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms<br />was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling<br />shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted.<br />A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale<br />undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night.<br />Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed<br />squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch<br />towards the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector<br />Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided<br />into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever<br />trod before.<br />The region now entered by the police was one of<br />traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and<br />untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden<br />lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge,<br />formless white polypus thing with luminous eyes; and<br />squatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of<br />caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said<br />it had been there before D'lberville, before La Salle, before<br />the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and<br />birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to see it was<br />to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to<br />keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the<br />merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was<br />bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship<br />had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds<br />and incidents.<br />Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises<br />heard by Legrasse's men as they ploughed on through the<br />black morass towards the red glare and the muffled tomtoms.<br />There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal<br />qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one<br />when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and<br />orgiastic licence here whipped themselves to demoniac<br />heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and<br />reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential<br />tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the less<br />organized ululations would cease, and from what seemed a<br />well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong<br />chant that hideous phrase or ritual:<br />'Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.'<br />Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees<br />were thinner, came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself.<br />Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into<br />a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately<br />deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the<br />face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly<br />hypnotized with horror.<br />In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of<br />perhaps an acre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On<br />this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of<br />human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola<br />could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were<br />braying, bellowing and writhing about a monstrous<br />ringshaped bonfire; in the centre of which, revealed by<br />occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite<br />monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which,<br />incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven<br />statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular<br />intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head<br />downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters<br />who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of<br />worshippers jumped and roared, the general direction of the<br />mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanale<br />between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.<br />It may have been only imagination and it may have been<br />only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable<br />Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the<br />ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the<br />wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D.<br />Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far as to<br />hint of the<br />faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes<br />and mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees - but<br />I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition.<br />Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively<br />brief duration. Duty came first; and although there<br />must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the<br />throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged<br />determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the<br />resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild<br />blows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made;<br />but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven<br />sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall<br />into line between two rows of policemen. Five of the<br />worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were<br />carried away on improvised stretchers by their<br />fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was<br />carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.<br />Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain<br />and weariness, the prisoners all proved to be men of a very<br />low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most<br />were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattos,<br />largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape<br />Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the<br />heterogeneous cult. But before many questions were asked<br />it became manifest that something far deeper and older<br />than negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant<br />as they were, the creatures held with suprising consistency<br />to the central idea of their loathsome faith.<br />They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who<br />lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the<br />young world out of the sky. These Old Ones were gone<br />now inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead<br />bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first man,<br />who formed a cult which had never died. This was that<br />cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and<br />always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark<br />places all over the world until the time when the great<br />priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of<br />R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth<br />again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the<br />stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be<br />waiting to liberate him.<br />Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret<br />which even torture could not extract. Mankind was not<br />absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for<br />shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these<br />were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old<br />Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might<br />say whether or not the others were precisely like him. No one<br />could read the old writing now, but things were told by word<br />of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret - that was<br />never spoken aloud, only whispered. The chant meant only<br />this: 'In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.'<br />Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be<br />hanged, and the rest were committed to various institutions.<br />All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the<br />killing had been done by Black-winged Ones which had<br />come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the<br />haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent<br />account could ever be gained. What the police did extract<br />came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named<br />Castro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and<br />talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of<br />China.<br />Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled<br />the speculations of theosophists and made man and the<br />world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been<br />aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had<br />had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless<br />Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean<br />stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of<br />time before man came, but there were arts which could<br />revive Them when the stars had come round again to the<br />right positions in the cycle of eternity. They had, indeed,<br />come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images<br />with Them.<br />These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not<br />composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape<br />for did not this star-fashioned image prove it? - but that<br />shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right,<br />They could plunge from world to world through the sky;<br />but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But<br />although They no longer lived, They would never really<br />die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of<br />R'lyeh preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a<br />glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might<br />once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force<br />from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The<br />spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented<br />Them from making an initial move, and They could only<br />lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions<br />of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the<br />universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted<br />thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When,<br />after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old<br />Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their<br />dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the<br />fleshy minds of mammals.<br />Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult<br />around small idols which the Great Ones showed them;<br />idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult would<br />never die till the stars came right again, and the secret<br />priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive<br />His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would<br />be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as<br />the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and<br />evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men<br />shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the<br />liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout<br />and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth<br />would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.<br />Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the<br />memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy<br />of their return.<br />In the elder time chosen men had talked with the<br />entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then something had<br />happened. The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths<br />and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep<br />waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not<br />even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse.<br />But memory never died, and high priests said that the city<br />would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of<br />the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and<br />full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten<br />sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much.<br />He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or<br />subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old<br />Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he<br />said that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts<br />of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden<br />and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult,<br />and was virtually unknown beyond its members. No book<br />had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen<br />said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of<br />the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might<br />read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:<br />That is not dead which can eternal lie,<br />And with strange aeons even death may die.<br />Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered,<br />had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the<br />cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said that<br />it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University<br />could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the<br />detective had come to the highest authorities in the<br />country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of<br />Professor Webb.<br />The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by<br />Legrasse's tale, corroborated as it was by the statuette, is<br />echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who<br />attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal<br />publication of the society. Caution is the first care of those<br />accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture.<br />Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb,<br />but at the latter's death it was returned to him and<br />remains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago.<br />It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the<br />dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.<br />That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I<br />did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon<br />hearing after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of<br />the cult, of a sensitive young man, who had dreamed not<br />only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swampfound<br />image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come<br />in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the<br />formula uttered alike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel<br />Louisianans? Professor Angell's instant start on an<br />investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently<br />natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of<br />having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of<br />having invented a series of dreams to heighten and<br />continue the mystery at my uncle's expense. The dreamnarratives<br />and cuttings collected by the professor were, of<br />course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my<br />mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to<br />adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So,<br />after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and<br />correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes<br />with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to<br />Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I<br />thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and<br />aged man.<br />Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in<br />Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian imitation of<br />seventeenth-century Breton architecture which flaunts its<br />stuccoed front amidst the lovely Colonial houses on the<br />ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest<br />Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his<br />rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered<br />about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He<br />will, I believe, be heard from some time as one of the great<br />decadents; for he has crystallized in clay and will one day<br />mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasia which<br />Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith<br />makes visible in verse and in painting.<br />Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned<br />languidly at my knock and asked me my business without<br />rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some<br />interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing<br />his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for<br />the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard,<br />but sought with some subtlety to draw him out.<br />In a short time I became convinced of his absolute<br />sincerity for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none<br />could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum had<br />influenced his art profoundly, and he showed me a morbid<br />statue whose contours almost made me shake with the<br />potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having<br />seen the original of this thing except in his own dream<br />bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly<br />under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape<br />he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing<br />of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless<br />catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I<br />strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have<br />received the weird impressions.<br />He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion;<br />making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean<br />city of slimy green stone - whose geometry, he oddly said, was<br />all wrong - and hear with frightened expectancy the<br />ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: 'Cthulhu<br />fhtagn, Cthulhu fhtagn.'<br />These words had formed part of that dread ritual which<br />told of dead Cthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at<br />R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs.<br />Wilcox, I was sure, had. heard of the cult in some casual<br />way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his<br />equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its<br />sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression<br />in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now<br />beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a<br />very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly<br />affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like;<br />but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and<br />his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all<br />the success his talent promises.<br />The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and<br />at times I had visions of personal fame from researches into<br />its origin and connections. I visited New Orleans, talked<br />with Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party,<br />saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the<br />mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately,<br />had been dead for some years. What I now heard<br />so graphically at first hand, though it was really no more<br />than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written,<br />excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a<br />very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose<br />discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My<br />attitude was still one of absolute materialism as I wish it still<br />were, and I discounted with a most inexplicable perversity<br />the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected<br />by Professor Angell.<br />One thing which I began to suspect, and which I now fear<br />I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural. He fell<br />on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront<br />swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a<br />negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine<br />pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be<br />surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as<br />ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and<br />beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone;<br />but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead.<br />Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering<br />the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears? I<br />think Professor Angel1 died because he knew too much, or<br />because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go<br />as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.<br />III. THE MADNESS FROM THE SEA<br />If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total<br />effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye<br />on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on<br />which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of<br />my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian<br />journal, Sydney Bulletin for 18 April 1925. It had escaped<br />even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its<br />issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's<br />research.<br />I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor<br />Angell called the 'Cthulhu Cult,' and was visiting a<br />learned friend of Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a<br />local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one<br />day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage<br />shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught<br />by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath<br />the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for<br />my friend has tide affiliations in all conceivable foreign<br />parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous<br />stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had<br />found in the swamp.<br />Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I<br />scanned the item in detail, and was disappointed to find it<br />of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was<br />of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I<br />carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as<br />follows:<br />MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA<br />Vigilant Arrives with Helpless Armed New Zealand<br />Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found<br />Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.<br />Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience.<br />Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to<br />Follow.<br />The Morrison Co's freighter Vigilant, bound from<br />Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling<br />Harbour having in tow the battled and disabled but<br />heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin NZ, which<br />was sighted 12 April in S. Latitude 34&deg; 21', W. Longitude<br />152&deg; 17', with one living and one dead man aboard.<br />The Vigilant left Valparaiso 25 March, and on 2 April was<br />driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally<br />heavy storms and monster waves. On 12 April the derelict<br />was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found<br />upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious<br />condition and one man who had evidently been dead for<br />more than a week.<br />The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of<br />unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose<br />nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society,<br />and the Museum in College Street all profess complete<br />bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin<br />of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.<br />This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly<br />strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen,<br />a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate<br />of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed<br />for Callao 20 February, with a complement of eleven men.<br />The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south<br />of her course by the great storm of 1 March, and on 22<br />March, in S. Latitude 49&ordm; 51', W. Longitude 128&ordm; 34',<br />encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking<br />crew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered<br />peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon<br />the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning<br />upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass<br />cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment.<br />The Emma's men showed fight, says the survivor, and<br />though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the<br />waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and<br />board her, grappling with the savage crew on the yacht's<br />deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being<br />slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and<br />desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.<br />Three of Emma's men, including Capt. Collins and First<br />Mate Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under<br />Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured<br />yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any<br />reason for their ordering back had existed.<br />The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small<br />island, although none is known to exist in that part of the<br />ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though<br />Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story and<br />speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.<br />Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht<br />and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm<br />of 2 April.<br />From that time till his rescue on the 12th, the man<br />remembers little, and he does not even recall when William<br />Briden, his companion, died. Briden's death reveals no<br />apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or<br />exposure.<br />Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well<br />known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation<br />along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of<br />half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the<br />woods attracted no little curiosity; and it had set sail in great<br />haste just after the storm and earth tremors of 1 March.<br />Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew<br />an excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober<br />and worthy man.<br />The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole<br />matter, beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be<br />made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he has<br />done hitherto.<br />This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image;<br />but what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were<br />new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence<br />that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What<br />motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as<br />they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the<br />unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died,<br />and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What<br />had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what<br />was known of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most<br />marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage<br />of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable<br />significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted<br />by my uncle?<br />1 March - our 28 February according to the International<br />Date Line - the earthquake and storm had come. From<br />Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly<br />forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of<br />the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange,<br />dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in<br />his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. 23 March the crew<br />of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men<br />dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed<br />a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant<br />monster's malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad<br />and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what<br />of this storm of 2 April - the date on which all dreams of the<br />dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the<br />bondage of strange fever? What of all this - and of those hints<br />of old Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their<br />coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams?<br />Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's<br />power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone,<br />for in some way the second of April had put a stop to<br />whatever monstrous menace had begun its seige of mankind's<br />soul.<br />That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and<br />arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train for San<br />Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin: where,<br />however, I found that little was known of the strange cultmembers<br />who had lingered in the old sea taverns.<br />Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention;<br />though there was vague talk about one inland trip these<br />mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red<br />flame were noted on the distant hills.<br />In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with<br />yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive<br />questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage<br />in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in<br />Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no<br />more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all they<br />could do was to give me his Oslo address.<br />After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with<br />seamen and members of the vice-admiralty court. I saw<br />the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, in Circular<br />Quay at Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its<br />noncommittal bulk. The crouching image with its<br />cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and<br />hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at<br />Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a<br />thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the<br />same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly<br />strangeness of material which I had noted in Legrasse's<br />smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator told me, had<br />found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world<br />held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of<br />what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great<br />Ones: 'They had come from the stars, and had brought<br />Their images with Them.'<br />Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never<br />before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo.<br />Sailing for London, I re-embarked at once for the Norwegian<br />capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in<br />the shadow of the Egeberg.<br />Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of<br />King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo<br />during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as<br />'Christiania.' I made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked<br />with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient<br />building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black<br />answered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment<br />when she told me in halting English that Gustaf<br />Johansen was no more.<br />He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the<br />doings at sea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no<br />more than he had told the public, but had left a long<br />manuscript - of 'technical matters' as he said - written in<br />English, evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of<br />casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near<br />the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic<br />window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once<br />helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach<br />him he was dead. Physicians found no adequate cause for the<br />end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.<br />I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will<br />never leave me till I, too, am at rest; 'accidentally' or<br />otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connection with<br />her husband's 'technical matters' was sufficient to entitle me<br />to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to<br />read it on the London boat.<br />It was a simple, rambling thing - a na&iuml;ve sailor's effort at a<br />postfacto diary - and strove to recall day by day that last<br />awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in<br />all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist<br />enough to show why the sound of the water against the<br />vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped<br />my ears with cotton.<br />Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though<br />he saw the city and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly<br />again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind<br />life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed<br />blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea,<br />known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to<br />loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall<br />heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.<br />Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the viceadmiralty.<br />The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on 20<br />February, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born<br />tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the<br />horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control,<br />the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert<br />on 22 March, and I could feel the mate's regret as he wrote of<br />her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on<br />the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some<br />peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their<br />destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shows ingenuous<br />wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against<br />his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry.<br />Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht<br />under Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone<br />pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47&ordm; 9', W.<br />Longitude 126&ordm; 43', come upon a coastline of mingled mud,<br />ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing<br />less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terrorthe<br />nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, that was built in<br />measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome<br />shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great<br />Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and<br />sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts<br />that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called<br />imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of<br />liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not<br />suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!<br />I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous<br />monolith-crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was<br />buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of<br />the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost<br />wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were<br />awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of<br />elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance<br />that it was nothing of this or any sane planet. Awe at the<br />unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the<br />dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the<br />stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs<br />with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is<br />poignantly visible in every line of the mate's frightened<br />description.<br />Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen<br />achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the<br />city; for instead of describing any definite structure or<br />building, he dwells only on the broad impressions of vast<br />angles and stone surfaces - surfaces too great to belong to<br />anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with<br />horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about<br />angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of<br />his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the<br />dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and<br />loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from<br />ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst<br />gazing at the terrible reality.<br />Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on<br />this monstrous acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over<br />titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal<br />staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when<br />viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from this<br />sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense<br />lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven<br />rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first<br />showed convexity.<br />Something very like fright had come over all the explorers<br />before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed<br />was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn<br />of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they<br />searched - vainly, as it proved - for some portable souvenir<br />to bear away.<br />It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot<br />of the monolith and shouted of what he had found. The rest<br />followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved<br />door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was,<br />Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that<br />it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and<br />jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it<br />lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellardoor.<br />As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place<br />was all wrong. One could not be sure that the sea and the<br />ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of<br />everything else seemed fantasmally variable.<br />Briden pushed at the stone in several places without<br />result. Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the<br />edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed<br />interminably along the grotesque stone moulding - that is,<br />one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all<br />horizontal - and the men wondered how any door in the<br />universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the<br />acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and they<br />saw that it was balanced.<br />Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or<br />along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone<br />watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven<br />portal. In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it moved<br />anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of<br />matter and perspective seemed upset.<br />The aperture was black with a darkness almost material.<br />That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it<br />obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been<br />revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its<br />aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it<br />slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping<br />membranous wings. The odour arising from the newly<br />opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quickeared<br />Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound<br />down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening<br />still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly<br />squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black<br />doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of<br />madness.<br />Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he<br />wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he<br />thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant.<br />The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for<br />such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such<br />eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic<br />order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder<br />that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor<br />Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The<br />Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had<br />awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and<br />what an age-old cult had failed to do by designs, a band of<br />innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of<br />years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for<br />delight.<br />Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before<br />anybody turned. God rest them, if there be any rest in the<br />universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera and Angstrom.<br />Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly<br />over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and<br />Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of<br />masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which<br />was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden<br />and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for<br />the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the<br />slimy stones and hesitated, floundering at the edge of the<br />water.<br />Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite<br />the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of<br />only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between<br />wheels and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst<br />the distorted horrors of the indescribable scene, she began to<br />chum the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that<br />charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the<br />stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the<br />fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied<br />Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and<br />began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic<br />potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing at<br />intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst<br />Johansen was wandering deliriously.<br />But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the<br />Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully<br />up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the<br />engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed<br />the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the<br />noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher<br />the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the<br />pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the<br />stern of a demon galleon. The awful squid-head with<br />writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy<br />yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly.<br />There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy<br />nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand<br />opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put<br />on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid<br />and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a<br />venomous seething astern; where - God in heaven! - the<br />scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was<br />nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its<br />distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus<br />from its mounting steam.<br />That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the<br />idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for<br />himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to<br />navigate after the first bold flight; for the reaction had taken<br />something out of his soul. Then came the storm of 2 April,<br />and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There<br />is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity,<br />of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet's tail,<br />and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from<br />the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating<br />chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green,<br />bat-winged mucking imps of Tartarus.<br />Out of that dream came rescue - the Vigilant the viceadmiralty<br />court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage<br />back home to the old house by the Egeberg He could not tell<br />-they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew<br />before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would<br />be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.<br />That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in<br />the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor<br />Angell. With it shall go this record of mine - this test of my<br />own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may<br />never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that<br />the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring<br />and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to<br />me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went,<br />as poor Johansen went, so shall I go. I know too much, and<br />the cult still lives.<br />Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of<br />stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His<br />accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over<br />the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still<br />bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in<br />lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking<br />whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now<br />be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end?<br />What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise.<br />Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay<br />spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come -<br />but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not<br />survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution<br />before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.</p>
