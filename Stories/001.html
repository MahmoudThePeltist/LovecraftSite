		<div class="storyhold"><p>I<br />I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why.<br />It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the<br />antarctic - with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice caps. And I am<br />the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain.<br />Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed what will seem<br />extravagant and incredible, there would be nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary<br />and aerial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted<br />because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will be<br />jeered at as obvious impostures, notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts ought to<br />remark and puzzle over.<br />In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have, on the one<br />hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in<br />the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles; and on the other hand, sufficient influence to<br />deter the exploring world in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region of those<br />mountains of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates,<br />connected only with a small university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a<br />wildly bizarre or highly controversial nature are concerned.<br />It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily<br />to be concerned. As a ge ologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly<br />that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided<br />by the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no<br />wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical<br />appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort<br />hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.<br />Pabodie&rsquo;s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and radical in its<br />lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the<br />small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head,<br />jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording,<br />rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep<br />all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry. This was<br />made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned. Four<br />large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic<br />plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport<br />our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and<br />from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us.<br />We planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season - or longer, if absolutely necessary - would<br />permit, operating mostly in the mountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored in<br />varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With frequent changes of camp, made by<br />aeroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a<br />quite unprecedented amount of material-especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range<br />of antarctic specimens had previously been secured. We wished also to obtain as great as possible a<br />variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm of ice and death is<br />of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earth&rsquo;s past. That the antarctic continent was once<br />temperate and even tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens, marine fauna,<br />arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals, is a matter of common information;<br />and we hoped to expand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed<br />fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size<br />and condition.<br />Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were to be<br />confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces - these inevitably being slopes and ridges because<br />of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could not afford to waste<br />drilling the depth of any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan<br />for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current<br />from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It is this plan - which we could not put into effect except experimentally<br />on an expedition such as ours - that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow,<br />despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the antarctic.<br />The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless reports to theArkham<br />Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of<br />four men from the University - Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics<br />department - also a meteorologist - and myself, representing geology and having nominal command -<br />besides sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics. Of these<br />sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane pilots, all but two of whom were competent wireless operators.<br />Eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and I. In<br />addition, of course, our two ships - wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary<br />steam - were fully manned.<br />The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, financed the expedition;<br />hence our preparations were extremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs,<br />sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in Boston,<br />and there our ships were loaded. We were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in<br />all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp construction we profited by the<br />excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number<br />and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition - ample though it was - so little noticed<br />by the world at large.<br />As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930, taking a leisurely<br />course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at<br />which latter place we took on final supplies. None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar<br />regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains - J. B. Douglas, commanding the brig<br />Arkham , and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorflnnssen, commanding the barque<br />Miskatonic - both veteran whalers in antarctic waters.<br />As we left the inhabited world behind, the sun sank lower and lower in the north, and stayed longer and<br />longer above the horizon each day. At about 62&deg; South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs - tablelike<br />objects with vertical sides - and just before reaching the antarctic circle, which we crossed on October<br />20th with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice. The falling<br />temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics, but I tried to brace up<br />for the worse rigors to come. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly;<br />these including a strikingly vivid mirage - the first I had ever seen - in which distant bergs became the<br />battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles.<br />Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed, we regained open<br />water at South Latitude 67&deg;, East Longitude 175&deg; On the morning of October 26th a strong land blink<br />appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and<br />snow-clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had<br />encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death. These<br />peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round<br />Cape Adare and sail down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of<br />McMurdo Sound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77&deg; 9'.<br />The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren peaks of mystery loomed up<br />constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun<br />of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits<br />of exposed granite slope. Through the desolate summits swept ranging, intermittent gusts of the terrible<br />antarctic wind; whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical<br />piping, with notes extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason<br />seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about the scene reminded me of the strange<br />and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more disturbing<br />descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which occur in the dreadedNecronomicon of the mad<br />Arab Abdul Alhazred. I was rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous book at the<br />college library.<br />On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost, we passed Franklin<br />Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the<br />long line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the<br />great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec,<br />and marking the end of southward navigation. In the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood<br />off the coast in the lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriac peak towered up some twelve thousand,<br />seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it<br />rose the white, ghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand, nine hundred feet in altitude, and now extinct<br />as a volcano.<br />Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate assistants - a brilliant young<br />fellow named Danforth - pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this<br />mountain, discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe&rsquo;s image when he wrote seven<br />years later:<br />- the lavas that restlessly roll<br />Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek<br />In the ultimate climes of the pole -<br />That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek<br />In the realms of the boreal pole.<br />Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a good deal of Poe. I was interested<br />myself because of the antarctic scene of Poe&rsquo;s only long story - the disturbing and enigmaticalArthur<br />Gordon Pym. On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriads of grotesque<br />penguins squawked and flapped their fins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or<br />sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.<br />Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after midnight on the morning of<br />the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a<br />breeches-buoy arrangement. Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poiguant and complex,<br />even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on<br />the frozen shore below the volcano&rsquo;s slope was only a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard<br />the Arkham. We landed all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline tanks,<br />experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial, aeroplane parts, and other accessories,<br />including three small portable wireless outfits - besides those in the planes - capable of communicating<br />with theArkham&rsquo;s large outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit. The<br />ship&rsquo;s outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey press reports to theArkham<br />Advertiser' s powerful wireless station on Kingsport Head, Massachusetts. We hoped to complete our<br />work during a single antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible, we would winter on theArkham,<br />sending theMiskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another summer&rsquo;s supplies.<br />I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work: of our ascent of<br />Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with<br />which Pabodie&rsquo;s apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the<br />small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our<br />final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp atop the barrier. The health of our land party -<br />twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge dogs - was remarkable, though of course we had so far<br />encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the thermometer varied<br />between zero and 20&deg; or 25&deg; above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us<br />to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semi-permanent, and destined to be a storage cache for<br />gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies.<br />Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth being left with a pilot<br />and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from theArkham in case<br />all our exploring planes were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we<br />would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent<br />base on the great plateau from six hundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore<br />Glacier. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the<br />plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of<br />economy and probable efficiency.<br />Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of our squadron on<br />November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences<br />echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped<br />us through the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between Latitudes<br />83&deg; and 84&deg;, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and<br />that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line. At last we were truly<br />entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt.<br />Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen thousand feet.<br />The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in Latitude 86&deg; 7&rsquo;, East Longitude<br />174&deg; 23&rsquo;, and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached<br />by our sledge trips and short aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as is the arduous and triumphant<br />ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students - Gedney and Carroll - on<br />December 13 - 15. We were some eight thousand, five hundred feet above sea-level, and when<br />experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain<br />points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed<br />dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens.<br />The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau<br />was homogeneous, with the great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts<br />lying eastward below South America - which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent<br />divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since<br />disproved the hypothesis.<br />In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their nature, we found some<br />highly interesting fossil markings and fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such<br />mollusks as linguellae and gastropods - all of which seemed of real significance in connection with the<br />region&rsquo;s primordial history. There was also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest<br />diameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted<br />aperture. These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and<br />Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to<br />my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary<br />rocks. Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed,<br />and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no<br />reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression.<br />On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself flew directly over the<br />south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately,<br />did not develop into a typical storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation<br />flights, during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by<br />previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though they afforded us<br />some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our<br />sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities,<br />and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams<br />and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun. On cloudy days we had<br />considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical<br />opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.<br />At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles eastward with all four<br />exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller<br />continental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological specimens obtained there would be<br />desirable for purposes of comparison. Our health so far had remained excellent - lime juice well offsetting<br />the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do<br />without our thickest furs. It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude<br />work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night. Several savage<br />windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in<br />devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and reinforcing the<br />principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.<br />The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake&rsquo;s strange and dogged<br />insistence on a westward - or rather, northwestward - prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new<br />base. It seems that he had pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular<br />striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which<br />whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the<br />west-stretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged. He was strangely<br />convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism<br />of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient<br />a date - Cambrian if not actually preCambrian - as to preclude the probable existence not only of all<br />highly evolved life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage. These<br />fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five hundred million to a thousand million years old.<br />II<br />Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake&rsquo;s start northwestward<br />into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not<br />mention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary<br />sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others - marred by the loss of<br />two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice - had brought up more and<br />more of the Archaean slate; and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings<br />in that unbelievably ancient stratum. These markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving<br />no great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as definitely pre-Cambrian as this<br />seemed to be; hence I still failed to see the good sense of Lake&rsquo;s demand for an interlude in our<br />time-saving program - an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men, and the whole of the<br />expedition&rsquo;s mechanical apparatus. I did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to<br />accompany the northwestward party despite Lake&rsquo;s plea for my geological advice. While they were<br />gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward<br />shift. In preparation for this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply<br />from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since it<br />is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeon-long<br />death.<br />Lake&rsquo;s subexpedition into the unknown, as everyone will recall, sent out its own reports from the<br />shortwave transmitters on the planes; these being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the<br />southern base and by theArkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world<br />on wave lengths up to fifty meters. The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and the first wireless<br />message we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of descending and starting a<br />small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point some three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a<br />second and very excited message told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft had been<br />sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately like<br />the one which had caused the original puzzlement.<br />Three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth of a raw and piercing<br />gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that his new<br />specimens made any hazard worth taking. I saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and<br />that I could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition&rsquo;s success; but it was appalling<br />to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests<br />and unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred miles to the half-known,<br />half-suspected coast line of Queen Mary and Knox Lands.<br />Then, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited message from Lake&rsquo;s moving plane,<br />which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish I had accompanied the party:<br />"10:05 P.M. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range ahead higher than any<br />hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing for height of plateau. Probable Latitude 76&deg; 15&rsquo;,<br />Longitude 113&deg; 10&rsquo; E. Reaches far as can see to right and left. Suspicion of two smoking cones.<br />All peaks black and bare of snow Gale blowing off them impedes navigation."<br />After that Pabodie, the men, and I hung breathlessly over the receiver. Thought of this titanic mountain<br />rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our<br />expedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In half an hour Lake called us again:<br />"Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt and perhaps can repair.<br />Shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further moves if necessary, but no more heavy<br />plane travel needed just now Mountains surpass anything in imagination. Am going up scouting in<br />Carroll&rsquo;s plane, with all weight out.<br />"You can&rsquo;t imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over thirty-five thousand feet.<br />Everest out of the running. Atwood to work out height with theodolite while Carroll and I go up.<br />Probably wrong about cones, for formations look stratified. Possibly preCam brian slate with<br />other strata mixed in. Queer skyline effects - regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks.<br />Whole thing marvelous in red-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or gateway to<br />forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to study."<br />Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners thought for a moment of retiring. It must<br />have been a good deal the same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and theArkham were also<br />getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find,<br />and Sherman, the cache operator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the<br />damaged aeroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at 11 P.M., came another call from<br />Lake:<br />"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don&rsquo;t dare try really tall peaks in present weather, but<br />shall later. Frightful work climbing, and hard going at this altitude, but worth it. Great range<br />fairly solid, hence can&rsquo;t get any glimpses beyond. Main summits exceed Himalayas, and very<br />queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian slate, with plain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was<br />wrong about volcanism. Goes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow<br />above about twenty-one thousand feet. "Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great<br />low square blocks with exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low, vertical ramparts, like<br />the old Asian castles clinging to steep mountains in Roerich&rsquo;s paintings. Impressive from distance.<br />Flew close to some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate pieces, but that is<br />probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate<br />changes for millions of years. "Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored rock<br />than any visible strata on slopes proper, hence of evidently crystalline origin. Close flying shows<br />many cave mouths, some unusually regular in outline, square or semicircular. You must come and<br />investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one peak. Height seems about thirty thousand<br />to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up twenty-one thousand, five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing<br />cold. Wind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves, but no flying danger so<br />far."<br />From then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of comment, and expressed his intention<br />of climbing some of the peaks on foot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,<br />and that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan-just where and how to concentrate our<br />supply in view of the expedition&rsquo;s altered character. Obviously, Lake&rsquo;s boring operations, as well as his<br />aeroplane activities, would require a great deal for the new base which he planned to establish at the foot<br />of the mountains; and it was possible that the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In<br />connection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of<br />the ships and up the barrier with the single dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown<br />region between Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to establish.<br />Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where Moulton&rsquo;s plane had been<br />forced down, and where repairs had already progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with<br />dark ground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before<br />making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene,<br />and the queer state of his sensations at being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a<br />wall reaching the sky at the world&rsquo;s rim. Atwood&rsquo;s theodolite observations had placed the height of the<br />five tallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet. The windswept nature of the terrain<br />clearly disturbed Lake, for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond anything<br />we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher foothills rose<br />abruptly. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words-flashed across a glacial void of<br />seven hundred miles - as he urged that we all hasten with the matter and get the strange, new region<br />disposed of as soon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day&rsquo;s work of almost<br />unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.<br />In the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and Captain Douglas at their widely<br />separated bases. It was agreed that one of Lake&rsquo;s planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five<br />men, and myself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of the fuel question, depending on our<br />decision about an easterly trip, could wait for a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp<br />heat and borings. Eventually the old southern base ought to be restocked, but if we postponed the<br />easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer, and, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore<br />a direct route between his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.<br />Pabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as the case might be. If we wintered<br />in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from Lake&rsquo;s base to theArkham without returning to this<br />spot. Some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow, and now we<br />decided to complete the job of making a permanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had<br />with him all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed that Pabodie and I would be<br />ready for the northwestward move after one day&rsquo;s work and one night&rsquo;s rest.<br />Our labors, however, were not very steady after 4 P.M., for about that time Lake began sending in the<br />most extraordinary and excited messages. His working day had started unpropitiously, since an<br />aeroplane survey of the nearly-exposed rock surfaces showed an entire absence of those Archaean and<br />primordial strata for which he was looking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that<br />loomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp. Most of the rocks glimpsed were apparently Jurassic<br />and Comanchian sandstones and Permian and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy black<br />outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal. This rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on<br />unearthing specimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear to him that in order to<br />recover the Archaean slate vein in which he had found the odd markings, he would have to make a long<br />sledge trip from these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselves.<br />He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the expedition&rsquo;s general program;<br />hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and<br />repairing the damaged aeroplane. The softest visible rock - a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from<br />the camp - had been chosen for the first sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much<br />supplementary blasting. It was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy blast of the<br />operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard; and that young Gedney - the acting foreman -<br />rushed into the camp with the startling news.<br />They had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of Comanchian<br />limestone, full of minute fossil cephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional suggestions<br />of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones-the latter probably of teleosts, sharks, and ganoids.<br />This, in itself, was important enough, as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet<br />secured; but when shortly afterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy, a<br />wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A good-sized blast<br />had laid open the subterrene secret; and now, through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and<br />three feet thick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn<br />more than fifty million years ago by the trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.<br />The hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off indefinitely in all<br />directions and had a fresh, slightly moving air which suggested its membership in an extensive<br />subterranean system. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites,<br />some of which met in columnar form: but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and<br />bones, which in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown jungles of Mesozoic<br />tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary cycads, fan palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous<br />medley contained representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other animal species than the<br />greatest paleontologist could have counted or classified in a year. Mollusks, crustacean armor, fishes,<br />amphibians, reptiles, birds, and early mammals - great and small, known and unknown. No wonder<br />Gedney ran back to the camp shouting, and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed<br />headlong through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to secrets of<br />inner earth and vanished aeons.<br />When Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity, he scribbled a message in his notebook and<br />had young Moulton run back to the camp to dispatch it by wireless. This was my first word of the<br />discovery, and it told of the identification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms, remnants of<br />labyrinthodonts and thecodonts, great mosasaur skull fragments, dinosaur vertebrae and armor plates,<br />pterodactyl teeth and wing bones, Archaeopteryx debris, Miocene sharks&rsquo; teeth, primitive bird skulls,<br />and other bones of archaic mammals such as palaeotheres, Xiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and<br />titanotheres. There was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer, or bovine animal;<br />hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the Oligocene Age, and that the<br />hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried, dead, and inaccessible state for at least thirty million years.<br />On the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular in the highest degree. Though the<br />limestone formation was, on the evidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively and<br />unmistakably Comanchian and not a particle earlier, the free fragments in the hollow space included a<br />surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods - even<br />rudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as the Silunan or Ordovician. The inevitable inference<br />was that in this part of the world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between<br />the life of over three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million years ago. How far this<br />continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene Age when the cavern was closed was of course past all<br />speculation. In any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some five hundred thousand<br />years ago - a mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavity - must have put an end to any of<br />the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common terms.<br />Lake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another bulletin written and dispatched<br />across the snow to the camp before Moulton could get back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in<br />one of the planes, transmitting to me - and to theArkham for relaying to the outside world - the frequent<br />postscripts which Lake sent him by a succession of messengers. Those who followed the newspapers<br />will remember the excitement created among men of science by that afternoon&rsquo;s reports - reports which<br />have finally led, after all these years, to the organization of that very Starkweather-Moore Expedition<br />which I am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes. I had better give the messages literally as Lake sent<br />them, and as our base operator McTighe translated them from the pencil shorthand:<br />"Fowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone fragments from<br />blasts. Several distinct triangular striated prints like those in Archaean slate, proving that source<br />survived from over six hundred million years ago to Comanchian times without more than<br />moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size, Comanchian prints apparently<br />more primitive or decadent, if anything, than older ones. Emphasize importance of discovery in<br />press. Will mean to biology what Einstein has meant to mathematics and physics. Joins up with<br />my previous work and amplifies conclusions.<br />"Appears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle or cycles of organic life<br />before known one that begins with Archaeozoic cells. Was evolved and specialized not later than a<br />thousand million years ago, when planet was young and recently uninhabitable for any life forms<br />or normal protoplasmic structure. Question arises when, where, and how development took<br />place."<br />"La ter. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine saurians and primitive<br />mammals, find singular local wounds or injuries to bony structure not attributable to any known<br />predatory or carnivorous animal of any period, of two sorts-straight, penetrant bores, and<br />apparently hacking incisions. One or two cases of cleanly severed bones. Not many specimens<br />affected. Am sending to camp for electric torches. Will extend search area underground by<br />hacking away stalactites."<br />"Still later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches across and an inch and a<br />half thick, wholly unlike any visible local formation - greenish, but no evidences to place its<br />period. Has curious smoothness and regularity. Shaped like five-pointed star with tips broken off,<br />and signs of other cleavage at inward angles and in center of su.rface. Small, smooth depression<br />in center of unbroken surface. Arouses much curiosity as to source and weathering. Probably<br />some freak of water action. Carroll, with magnifier, thinks he can make out additional markings<br />of geologic significance. Groups of tiny dots in regular patterns. Dogs growing uneasy as we<br />work, and seem to hate this soapstone. Must see if it has any peculiar odor. Will report again<br />when Mills gets back with light and we start on underground area."<br />"10:15 P.M. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working underground at 9:45 with<br />light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil of wholly unknown nature; probably vegetable unless<br />overgrown specimen of unknown marine radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral salts.<br />Tough as leather, but astonishing flexibility retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends<br />and around sides. Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering to one<br />foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of<br />thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious<br />growths - combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans. All greatly damaged but one,<br />which gives almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of<br />primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things inNecronomicon.<br />"Their wings seem to be membranous, stretched on frame work of glandular tubing. Apparent<br />minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends of body shriveled, giving no clue to interior or<br />to what has been broken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp. Can&rsquo;t decide whether<br />vegetable or animal. Many features obviously of almost incredible primitiveness. Have set all<br />hands cutting stalactites and looking for further specimens. Additional scarred bones found, but<br />these must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They can&rsquo;t endure the new specimen, and would<br />probably tear it to pieces if we didn&rsquo;t keep it at a distance from them."<br />"11:30 P.M. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highest - I might say transcendent -<br />importance. Arkham must relay to Kingsport Head Station at once. Strange barrel growth is the<br />Archaean thing that left prints in rocks. Mills, Boudreau, and Fowler discover cluster of thirteen<br />more at underground point forty feet from aperture. Mixed with curiously rounded and configured<br />soapstone fragments smaller than one previously found - star-shaped, but no marks of breakage<br />except at some of the points.<br />"Of organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages. Have brought all to<br />surface, leading off dogs to distance. They cannot stand the things. Give close attention to<br />description and repeat back for accuracy Papers must get this right.<br />"Objects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel torso three and five-tenths feet<br />central diameter, one foot end diameters. Dark gray, flexible, and infinitely tough. Seven-foot<br />membranous wings of same color, found folded, spread out of furrows between ridges. Wing<br />framework tubular or glandular, of lighter gray, with orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have<br />serrated edge. Around equator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical, stave-like ridges<br />are five systems of light gray flexible arms or tentacles found tightly folded to torso but<br />expansible to maximum length of over three feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid. Single stalks<br />three inches diameter branch after six inches into five substalks, each of which branches after<br />eight inches into small, tapering tentacles or tendrils, giving each stalk a total of twenty-five<br />tentacles.<br />"At top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like suggestions, holds yellowish<br />five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent head covered with three-inch wiry cilia of various prismatic<br />colors.<br />"Head thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch flexible yellowish tubes<br />projecting from each point. Slit in exact center of top probably breathing aperture. At end of each<br />tube is spherical expansion where yellowish membrane rolls back on handling to reveal glassy,<br />red-irised globe, evidently an eye.<br />"Five slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of starfish-shaped head and end in<br />saclike swellings of same color which, upon pressure, open to bell-shaped orifices two inches<br />maximum diameter and lined with sharp, white toot hlike projections - probably mouths. All these<br />tubes, cilia, and points of starfish head, found folded tightly down; tubes and points clinging to<br />bulbous neck and torso. Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness.<br />"At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of head arrangements exist.<br />Bulbous light-gray pseudo-neck, without gill suggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish<br />arrangement.<br />"Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches diameter at base to about<br />two and five-tenths at point. To each point is attached small end of a greenish five-veined mem<br />branous triangle eight inches long and six wide at farther end. This is the paddle, fin, or<br />pseudofoot which has made prints in rocks from a thousand million to fifty or sixty million years<br />old.<br />"From inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish tubes tapering from three<br />inches diameter at base to one at tip. Orifices at tips. All these parts infinitely tough and leathery,<br />but extremely flexible. Four-foot arms with paddles undoubtedly used for locomotion of some<br />sort, marine or otherwise. When moved, display suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As<br />found, all these pro jections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso, corresponding to<br />projections at other end.<br />"Cannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds now favor animal.<br />Probably represents incredibly advanced evolution of radiata without loss of certain primitive<br />features. Echinoderm resemblances unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences.<br />"Wing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may have use in water<br />navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegeta blelike, suggesting vegetable 's essential up-and-down<br />structure rather than animal&rsquo;s fore-and-aft structure. Fabulously early date of evolution,<br />preceding even simplest Archaean protozoa hitherto known, baffles all conjecture as to origin.<br />"Complete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures of primal myth that<br />suggestion of ancient existence outside antarctic becomes inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read<br />Necronomicon and seen Clark Ashton Smith&rsquo;s nightmare paintings based on text, and will<br />understand when I speak of Elder Things supposed to have created all earth life as jest or<br />mistake. Students have always thought conception formed from morbid imaginative treatment of<br />very ancient tropical radiata. Also like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has spoken of -<br />Cthulhu cult appendages, etc.<br />"Vast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous or early Eocene period, judging<br />from associated specimens. Massive stalagmites deposited above them. Hard work hewing out,<br />but toughness prevented damage. State of preservation miraculous, evidently owing to limestone<br />action. No more found so far, but will resume search later. Job now to get fourteen huge<br />specimens to camp without dogs, which bark furiously and can&rsquo;t be trusted near them.<br />"With nine men - three left to guard the dogs-we ought to manage the three sledges fairly well,<br />though wind is bad. Must establish plane communication with McMurdo Sound and begin<br />shipping material. But I&rsquo;ve got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest. Wish I had a<br />real laboratory here. Dyer better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip. First the<br />world&rsquo;s greatest mountains, and then this. If this last isn&rsquo;t the high spot of the expedition, I don&rsquo;t<br />know what is. We&rsquo;re made scientifically. Congrats, Pabodie, on the drill that opened up the cave.<br />Now will Arkhamplease repeat description?"<br />The sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description, nor were<br />our companions much behind us in enthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as<br />they came from the droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version as<br />soon as Lake&rsquo;s operator signed off. All appreciated the epoch-making significance of the discovery, and<br />I sent Lake congratulations as soon as theArkham&rsquo;s operator had repeated back the descriptive parts as<br />requested; and my example was followed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply<br />cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of theArkham . Later, as head of the expedition, I added some<br />remarks to be relayed through theArkham to the outside world. Of course, rest was an absurd thought<br />amidst this excitement; and my only wish was to get to Lake&rsquo;s camp as quickly as I could. It<br />disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early aerial travel impossible.<br />But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake, sending more messages,<br />told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp. It had been<br />a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly heavy; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now<br />some of the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to which the<br />dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The specimens were laid out on the hard snow<br />near the camp, save for one on which Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.<br />This dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected, for, despite the heat of a gasoline<br />stove in the newly raised laboratory tent, the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen specimen-a<br />powerful and intact one - lost nothing of their more than leathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how<br />he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the structural<br />niceties he was looking for. He had, it is true, seven more perfect specimens; but these were too few to<br />use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited supply. Accordingly he removed the<br />specimen and dragged in one which, though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both ends,<br />was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.<br />Results, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and provocative indeed. Nothing like delicacy<br />or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little that was<br />achieved left us all awed and bewildered. Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing<br />was no product of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely any mineral<br />replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million years, the internal organs were wholly intact.<br />The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing&rsquo;s<br />form of organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our<br />powers of speculation. At first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced its thawing<br />effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odor was encountered toward the thing&rsquo;s uninjured<br />side. It was not blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose. By the time<br />Lake reached this stage, all thirty-seven dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the<br />camp, and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid, diffusive<br />smell.<br />Far from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery. All<br />guesses about its external members had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly<br />hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake<br />was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the<br />reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would say that its respiration apparatus handled<br />oxygen rather than carbon dioxide, and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods<br />of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing systems -<br />gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian, and probably adapted to long airless hibernation periods as<br />well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection with the main respiratory system, but they presented<br />anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable utterance, seemed barely<br />conceivable, but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system<br />was almost prematurely developed.<br />The nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake aghast. Though excessively<br />primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had a set of ganglial centers and connectives arguing the<br />very extremes of specialized development. Its five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were<br />signs of a sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head, involving factors alien to<br />any other terrestrial organism. Probably it has more than five senses, so that its habits could not be<br />predicted from any existing analogy. It must, Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness<br />and delicately differentiated functions in its primal world - much like the ants and bees of today. It<br />reproduced like the vegetable crytogams, especially the Pteridophyta, having spore cases at the tips of<br />the wings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus.<br />But to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a radiate, but was clearly something<br />more. It was partly vegetable, but had three-fourths of the essentials of animal structure. That it was<br />marine in origin, its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated; yet one could not<br />be exact as to the limit of its later adaptations. The wings, after all, held a persistent suggestion of the<br />aerial. How it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a new-born earth in time to<br />leave prints in Archaean rocks was so far beyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the<br />primal myths about Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life as a joke<br />or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by a folklorist colleague in<br />Miskatonic&rsquo;s English department.<br />Naturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints having been made by a less evolved<br />ancestor of the present specimens, but quickly rejected this too-facile theory upon considering the<br />advanced structural qualities of the older fossils. If anything, the later contours showed decadence rather<br />than higher evolution. The size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology seemed<br />coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs just examined held singular suggestions of<br />retrogression from forms still more complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent.<br />Altogether, little could be said to have been solved; and Lake fell back on mythology for a provisional<br />name - jocosely dubbing his finds "The Elder Ones."<br />At about 2:30 A.M., having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest, he covered the<br />dissected organism with a tarpaulin, emerged from the laboratory tent, and studied the intact specimens<br />with renewed interest. The ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle, so that the<br />head points and tubes of two or three showed signs of unfolding; but Lake did not believe there was any<br />danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He did, however, move all the undissected<br />specimens close together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That<br />would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs, whose hostile unrest was really<br />becoming a problem, even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which<br />an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters. He had to weight down the<br />corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan<br />mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early apprehensions about sudden<br />antarctic winds were revived, and under Atwood&rsquo;s supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents,<br />new dog corral, and crude aeroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side. These latter shelters,<br />begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as they should have been;<br />and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.<br />It was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his<br />outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie over<br />the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills that had helped him make his discovery.<br />Atwood also sent greetings and praises. I gave Lake a warm word of congratulations, owning up that he<br />was right about the western trip, and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning. If the<br />gale was then over, Lake would send a plane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I dispatched a<br />final message to theArkham with instructions about toning down the day&rsquo;s news for the outside world,<br />since the full details seemed radical enough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.<br />III<br />None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning. Both the excitement of Lake&rsquo;s<br />discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing. So savage was the blast, even<br />where we were, that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at Lake&rsquo;s camp, directly<br />under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it. McTighe was awake at ten o&rsquo;clock and tried to<br />get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the westward<br />seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get theArkham , and Douglas told me that he had<br />likewise been vainly trying to reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was blowing<br />at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.<br />Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals, but invariably without<br />results. About noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety<br />of our camp; but it eventually died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o&rsquo;clock it<br />was very quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each<br />provided with an excellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of<br />crippling all his wireless equipment at once. Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we<br />thought of the delirious force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more<br />direful conjectures.<br />By six o&rsquo;clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless consultation with Douglas<br />and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward investigation. The fifth aeroplane, which we had left at<br />the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for<br />instant use, and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us. I got<br />Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the southern base<br />as quickly as possible, the air conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over the<br />personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that we would include all hands, together with<br />the sledge and dogs which I had kept with me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one of<br />the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery transportation. At intervals I still tried to<br />reach Lake with the wireless, but all to no purpose.<br />Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30; and reported a quiet flight from<br />several points on the wing. They arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next<br />move. It was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but<br />no one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o&rsquo;clock for a brief<br />rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were up again in four hours to finish the loading and<br />packing.<br />At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe&rsquo;s pilotage with ten men,<br />seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other items including the plane&rsquo;s wireless outfit. The<br />atmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little<br />trouble in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our<br />apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of our journey, for silence<br />continued to answer all calls dispatched to the camp.<br />Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial<br />position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the<br />normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external nature and nature&rsquo;s laws.<br />Thenceforward the ten of us - but the student Danforth and myself above all others - were to face a<br />hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we<br />would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins<br />we sent from the moving plane, telling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air<br />gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before,<br />and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in<br />the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau. There came a point, though, when our sensations<br />could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand, and a latter point when we had to<br />adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.<br />The sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles ahead, and his shouts<br />sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane. Despite our speed, they were very slow in<br />gaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off, and visible only because of their<br />abnormal height. Little by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky; allowing us to distinguish<br />various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and to catch the curious sense of fantasy which they inspired as<br />seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent ice-dust clouds. In the<br />whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation. It<br />was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of<br />dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space, and ultradimensionality. I could not help feeling that they<br />were evil things-mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate<br />abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal<br />beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness,<br />separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world.<br />It was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skyline -<br />regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and<br />which indeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial temple ruins, on<br />cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by Roerich. There was indeed something<br />hauntingly Roerich-like about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in<br />October when we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now. I felt, too, another wave of<br />uneasy consciousness of Archaean mythical resemblances; of how disturbingly this lethal realm<br />corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings. Mythologists have placed Leng in<br />Central Asia; but the racial memory of man - or of his predecessors - is long, and it may well be that<br />certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than Asia and<br />earlier than any human world we know. A few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for<br />the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien<br />to mankind as Tsathoggua itself. Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I<br />would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous<br />and Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever<br />read the abhorredNecronomicon , or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at<br />the university.<br />This mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from<br />the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative<br />undulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them<br />quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present example; but this one had a wholly novel and<br />obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and<br />towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice vapors above our heads.<br />The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination, with<br />vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There<br />were truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there<br />bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks; and strange beetling, table-like<br />constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars<br />with each one overlapping the one beneath. There were composite cones and pyramids either alone or<br />surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and occasional needle-like spires<br />in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing<br />from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and<br />oppressive in its sheer gigantism. The general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms<br />observed and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820, but at this time and place, with those dark,<br />unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our<br />minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition, we all seemed to<br />find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portent.<br />I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare turrets and<br />cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to<br />churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey&rsquo;s end was not far off.<br />The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities<br />showing with startling clearness even without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and<br />could see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which<br />we took to be Lake&rsquo;s camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away,<br />forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond them. At<br />length Ropes-the student who had relieved McTighe at the controls - began to head downward toward<br />the left-hand dark spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last<br />uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition.<br />Everyone, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn.<br />Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found, and reluctantly<br />announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the<br />night before that. Eleven known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of details<br />through realization of the shock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we explained<br />that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside.<br />Indeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment, and soul-clutching<br />horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance. The tremendous significance lies in<br />what we dared not tell; what I would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless<br />terrors.<br />It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have lived through it, even without<br />the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have<br />been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before. One aeroplane shelter-wall, it seems, had<br />been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state - was nearly pulverized-and the derrick at the distant<br />boring was entirely shaken to pieces. The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery<br />was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking.<br />Wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the<br />snow were completely obliterated. It is also true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in<br />a condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals from a vast, tumbled pile, including<br />several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of<br />grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most<br />typical of the curiously injured specimens.<br />None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp being almost wholly<br />destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage on the side next the camp, which<br />was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves. All three<br />sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the<br />unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage,<br />so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We<br />likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since our surviving party had only four<br />real pilots - Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes - in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to<br />navigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find,<br />though much was rather unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly<br />out of condition.<br />It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we<br />sent our guarded message to theArkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and<br />noncommittal as we succeeded in doing. The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose<br />frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor Lake&rsquo;s accounts. We did<br />not mention, I think, their display of the same uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish<br />soapstones and certain other objects in the disordered region-objects including scientific instruments,<br />aeroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp and at the boring, whose parts had been loosened, moved,<br />or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and investigativeness.<br />About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite. We said that the only ones we<br />discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of them to prove Lake&rsquo;s description wholly and<br />impressively accurate. It was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this matter - and we did<br />not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find. We had by that time<br />agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of Lake&rsquo;s men, and it surely looked like<br />madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully buried upright in nine-foot snow graves under<br />five-pointed mounds punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly those on the queer greenish<br />soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times. The eight perfect specimens mentioned by Lake<br />seemed to have been completely blown away.<br />We were careful, too, about the public&rsquo;s general peace of mind; hence Danforth and I said little about<br />that frightful trip over the mountains the next day. It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could<br />possibly cross a range of such height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our<br />return at one A.M., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an admirably stiff upper lip. It took no<br />persuasion to make him promise not to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our<br />pockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to hide<br />our camera films for private development later on; so that part of my present story will be as new to<br />Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world in general. Indeed, Danforth is<br />closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or thinks he saw, one thing he will not tell even me.<br />As all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent - a confirmation of Lake&rsquo;s opinion that the great<br />peaks are of Archaean slate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle<br />Comanchian times; a conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart formations;<br />a decision that the cave mouths indicate dissolved calcaerous veins; a conjecture that certain slopes and<br />passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers; and a<br />remark that the mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging<br />as the mountains themselves - twenty thousand feet in elevation, with grotesque rock formations<br />protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface<br />and the sheer precipices of the highest peaks.<br />This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely satisfied the men at the<br />camp. We laid our absence of sixteen hours - a longer time than our announced flying, landing,<br />reconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called for - to a long mythical spell of adverse wind<br />conditions, and told truly of our landing on the farther foothills. Fortunately our tale sounded realistic and<br />prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that, I would<br />have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop them - and I do not know what Danforth would have<br />done. While we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like<br />beavers over Lake&rsquo;s two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable<br />juggling of their operative mechanism.<br />We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base as soon as possible.<br />Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work toward McMurdo Sound; for a straightline flight<br />across the most utterly unknown stretches of the aeon-dead continent would involve many additional<br />hazards. Further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our<br />drilling machinery. The doubts and horrors around us-which we did not reveal - made us wish only to<br />escape from this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could.<br />As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters. All planes<br />reached the old base on the evening of the next day-january 27th-after a swift nonstop flight; and on the<br />28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty<br />rudder in the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great plateau. In five days more, the<br />Arkham andMiskatonic, with all hands and equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening<br />field ice and working up Ross Sea with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land looming westward<br />against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind&rsquo;s wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which<br />chilled my soul to the quick. Less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind us and<br />thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted, accursed realm where life and death, space and time,<br />have made black and blasphemous alliances, in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam<br />on the planet&rsquo;s scarce-cooled crust.<br />Since our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic exploration, and have kept certain<br />doubts and guesses to ourselves with splendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his<br />nervous breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors - indeed, as I have said, there is one thing<br />he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his psychological state<br />if he would consent to do so. It might explain and relieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more<br />than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after those rare,<br />irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me - things which he repudiates vehemently<br />as soon as he gets a grip on himself again.<br />It will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and some of our efforts may directly<br />harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice. We might have known from the first that human curiosity is<br />undying, and that the results we announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long<br />pursuit of the unknown. Lake&rsquo;s reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and<br />paleontologists to the highest pitch, though we were sensible enough not to show the detached parts we<br />had taken from the actual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found.<br />We also refrained from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while<br />Dan-forth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across the range,<br />and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away in our pockets.<br />But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our<br />outfit attempted. If not dissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore<br />till they bring up that which we know may end the world. So I must break through all reticences at last -<br />even about that ultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.<br />IV<br />It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to Lake&rsquo;s camp and what we<br />really found there - and to that other thing beyond the mountains of madness. I am constantly tempted to<br />shirk the details, and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said<br />enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the camp. I have told<br />of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the disarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of<br />our dogs, the missing sledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and<br />the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries, from<br />a world forty million years dead. I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon checking up the canine<br />bodies we found one dog missing. We did not think much about that till later - indeed, only Danforth and<br />I have thought of it at all.<br />The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain subtle points which may<br />or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos. At the time, I tried to<br />keep the men&rsquo;s minds off those points; for it was so much simpler - so much more normal - to lay<br />everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake&rsquo;s party. From the look of things, that<br />demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive any man mad in the midst of this center of all<br />earthly mystery and desolation.<br />The crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the bodies - men and dogs alike. They had all<br />been in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable<br />ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case come from strangulation or laceration. The dogs<br />had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their ill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage<br />from within. It had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those<br />hellish Archaean organisms, but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that<br />monstrous wind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have stampeded - whether from the<br />wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.<br />But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had better put<br />squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last - though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on<br />the first-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and myself, that the then missing<br />Gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the bodies were<br />frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious,<br />cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies,<br />quadrupedal or bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful<br />butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt - taken from the ravaged provision chests on<br />the planes - which conjured up the most horrible associations. The thing had occurred in one of the crude<br />aeroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all<br />tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing, roughly slashed from<br />the human incision subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint<br />snow prints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure - because that impression did not concern<br />human prints at all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been<br />giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one&rsquo;s imagination in the lee of those<br />overshadowing mountains of madness.<br />As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end. When we came on that<br />terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we<br />entered after investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal. It was not as Lake had left it,<br />for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we<br />had already realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had found - the one with<br />the trace of a peculiarly hateful odor - must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake had<br />tried to analyze. On and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it did not take long<br />for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one<br />man and one dog. I shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man&rsquo;s identity. Lake&rsquo;s<br />anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences of their careful cleansing. The gasoline<br />stove was also gone, though around it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human parts<br />beside the other ten men; and the canine parts with the other thirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre<br />smudges on the laboratory table, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered near it,<br />we were much too bewildered to speculate.<br />This formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were equally perplexing. The disappearance<br />of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain<br />instruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing materials, electric torches and batteries,<br />food and fuel, heating apparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond sane conjecture;<br />as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on certain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious<br />alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp<br />and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery. Then, too, there was the<br />upsetting of the larder, the disappearance of certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans<br />pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches,<br />intact, broken, or spent, formed another minor enigma - as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits<br />which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at<br />unimaginable adaptations. The maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial of the<br />damaged Archaean specimens, were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness. In view of<br />just such an eventuality as the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane<br />disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed<br />Starkweather-Moore Expedition.<br />Our first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open the row of insane graves<br />with the five-pointed snow mounds. We could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous<br />mounds, with their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake&rsquo;s descriptions of the strange greenish<br />soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral pile, we found<br />the likeness very close indeed. The whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably<br />suggestive of the starfish head of the Archaean entities; and we agreed that the suggestion must have<br />worked potently upon the sensitized minds of Lake&rsquo;s overwrought party.<br />For madness - centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent - was the explanation<br />spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so<br />naive as to deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate<br />completely. Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all the<br />surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon with field glasses in quest of Gedney and of<br />the various missing things; but nothing came to light. The party reported that the titan barrier range<br />extended endlessly to right and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential structure. On some<br />of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer, having doubly<br />fantastic similitudes to Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the<br />black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced.<br />In spite of all the prevailing horrors, we were left with enough sheer scientific zeal and adventurousness to<br />wonder about the unknown realm beyond those mysterious mountains. As our guarded messages stated,<br />we rested at midnight after our day of terror and bafflement - but not without a tentative plan for one or<br />more range-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera and geologist&rsquo;s outfit, beginning<br />the following morning. It was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending<br />an early flight; however, heavy winds - mentioned in our brief, bulletin to the outside world - delayed our<br />start till nearly nine o&rsquo;clock.<br />I have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at camp - and relayed outside - after our<br />return sixteen hours later. It is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks<br />with hints of what we really saw in the hidden transmontane world - hints of the revelations which have<br />finally driven Danforth to a nervous collapse. I wish he would add a really frank word about the thing<br />which he thinks he alone saw - even though it was probably a nervous delusion - and which was perhaps<br />the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm against that. All I can do is to repeat his later<br />disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the wind-tortured<br />mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I shared. This will form my last word. If the plain<br />signs of surviving elder horrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the<br />inner antarctic-or at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden<br />secrets and inhuman, aeon-cursed desolation - the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps<br />immeasurable evils will not be mine.<br />Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a<br />sextant, had calculated that the lowest available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within<br />sight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level. For this<br />point, then, we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery. The camp<br />itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude;<br />hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were<br />actually conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions,<br />we had to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our heaviest furs.<br />As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of crevasse-riven snow and<br />interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and<br />thought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. The ancient and wind-weathered rock<br />strata fully verified all of Lake&rsquo;s bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering up in exactly<br />the same way since.a surprisingly early time in earth&rsquo;s history-perhaps over fifty million years. How much<br />higher they had once been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange region pointed to<br />obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to change, and calculated to retard the usual climatic<br />processes of rock disintegration.<br />But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave mouths which fascinated and<br />disturbed us most. I studied them with a field glass and took aerial photographs while Danforth drove;<br />and at times I relieved him at the controls - though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur&rsquo;s - in<br />order to let him use the binoculars. We could easily see that much of the material of the things was a<br />lightish Archaean quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface; and that<br />their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.<br />As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering; but<br />their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially<br />those closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface. The whole<br />arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish<br />as dug up by the Oxford Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I obtained that<br />occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion<br />Carroll. How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly humbled<br />as a geologist. Igneous formations often have strange regularities - like the famous Giants&rsquo; Causeway in<br />Ireland-but this stupendous range, despite Lake&rsquo;s original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else<br />nonvolcanic in evident structure.<br />The curious cave mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most abundant, presented another<br />albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline. They were, as Lake&rsquo;s bulletin had said, often<br />approximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by<br />some magic hand. Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the<br />whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata. Such glimpses as we<br />secured did not extend far within the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites<br />and stalagmites. Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably<br />smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended<br />toward unusual patterns. Filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he<br />hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval<br />greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six<br />buried monstrosities.<br />We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had<br />selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route,<br />wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days.<br />Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite<br />the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a<br />Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with<br />unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception.<br />Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden<br />world can hardly be described on paper; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the<br />range essentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch of evil mystery in these<br />barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a<br />highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it an affair of vague<br />psychological symbolism and aesthetic association - a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings,<br />and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind&rsquo;s burden held a peculiar<br />strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre<br />musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and<br />resonant cave mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and<br />unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions.<br />We were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand, five hundred and seventy feet<br />according to the aneroid; and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only<br />dark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers - but with those provocative cubes,<br />ramparts, and echoing cave mouths to add a portent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.<br />Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one mentioned by poor Lake, with a<br />rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be half lost in a queer antarctic haze - such a haze, perhaps, as had<br />been responsible for Lake&rsquo;s early notion of volcanism. The pass loomed directly before us, smooth and<br />windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling<br />vapors and lighted by the low polar sun - the sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no<br />human eye had ever gazed.<br />A few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth and I, unable to speak except in<br />shouts amidst the howling, piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the<br />unmuffled engines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last few feet, we did<br />indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien<br />earth.<br />V<br />I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder, terror, and disbelief in our own<br />senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond. Of course, we must have had some<br />natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment. Probably we thought of<br />such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the<br />fantastically symmetrical wind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought the sight<br />a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness. We<br />must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless,<br />tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically<br />eurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than<br />forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest, and in places obviously thinner.<br />The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish violation of known natural law<br />seemed certain at the outset. Here, on a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high, and in<br />a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less than five hundred thousand years ago, there<br />stretched nearly to the vision&rsquo;s limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental<br />self-defense could possibly attribute to any but conscious and artificial cause. We had previously<br />dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the<br />mountainsides were other than natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself could<br />scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the<br />present unbroken reign of glacial death?<br />Yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this Cyclopean maze of squared, curved, and<br />angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city<br />of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality. That damnable portent had had a material basis<br />after all - there had been some horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this shocking stone<br />survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection, Of<br />course, the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source<br />did not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it even more hideous and menacing than<br />its distant image.<br />Only the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful<br />things from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - of years it had brooded<br />there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland. "Corona Mundi - Roof of the World - " All sorts of fantastic<br />phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle. I thought again of the<br />eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world -<br />of the demoniac plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or abominable Snow Men of the Himalayas, of the<br />Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman implications, of the Cthulhu cult, of theNecronomicon , and of<br />the Hyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless star spawn associated with<br />that semientity.<br />For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning; indeed, as our eyes<br />followed it to the right and left along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it from the<br />actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left<br />of the pass through which we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of something of<br />incalculable extent. The foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures, linking the<br />terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts.<br />These latter, as well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the<br />mountains.<br />The nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of walls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet<br />in ice-clear height, and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet. It was composed mostly of prodigious<br />blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and sandstone - blocks in many cases as large as 4 x 6 x 8 feet -<br />though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock of preCambrian slate.<br />The buildings were far from equal in size, there being innumerable honeycomb arrangements of enormous<br />extent as well as smaller separate structures. The general shape of these things tended to be conical,<br />pyramidal, or terraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes, clusters of cubes, and<br />other rectangular forms, and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan<br />roughly suggested modern fortifications. The builders had made constant and expert use of the principle<br />of the arch, and domes had probably existed in the city&rsquo;s heyday.<br />The whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface from which the towers projected<br />was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see<br />the lower parts of the gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved stone bridges which connected the<br />different towers at varying distances above the ground. On the exposed walls we could detect the<br />scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed. Closer inspection revealed<br />countless largish windows; some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally<br />wood, though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion. Many of the ruins, of course, were<br />roofless, and with uneven though wind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or<br />pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures, preserved intact outlines despite the<br />omnipresent crumbling and pitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to be<br />sculptural decorations in horizontal bands - decorations including those curious groups of dots whose<br />presence on the ancient soapstones now assumed a vastly larger significance.<br />In many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet deeply riven from various geologic<br />causes. In other places the stonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation. One broad<br />swath, extending from the plateau&rsquo;s interior, to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass<br />we had traversed, was wholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we concluded, the course of<br />some great river which in Tertiary times - millions of years ago - had poured through the city and into<br />some prodigious subterranean abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was above all a region of<br />caves, gulfs, and underground secrets beyond human penetration.<br />Looking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from<br />aeons we had thought prehuman, I can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium,<br />which we did. Of course, we knew that something - chronology, scientific theory, or our own<br />consciousness - was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane, observe many things<br />quite minutely, and take a careful series of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in<br />good stead. In my case, ingrained scientific habit may have helped; for above all my bewilderment and<br />sense of menace, there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this age-old secret - to know what<br />sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and what relation to the general world<br />of its time or of other times so unique a concentration of life could have had.<br />For this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the primary nucleus and center of some<br />archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth&rsquo;s history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in<br />the most obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long<br />before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom. Here sprawled a Palaeogaean<br />megalopolis compared with which the fabled Atlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and<br />Olathoc in the land of Lomar, are recent things of today - not even of yesterday; a megalopolis ranking<br />with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as Valusia, R&rsquo;lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless<br />city of Arabia Deserta. As we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes<br />escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations - even weaving links betwixt<br />this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp.<br />The plane&rsquo;s fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly filled; hence we now had to<br />exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of ground - or,<br />rather, air - after swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to<br />be no limit to the mountain range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner<br />foothills. Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and<br />masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice. There were, though, some highly absorbing<br />diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills<br />and approached its sinking place in the great range. The headlands at the stream&rsquo;s entrance had been<br />boldly carved into Cyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs stirred up<br />oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semi-remembrances in both Danforth and me.<br />We also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public squares, and noted various<br />undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp hill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of<br />rambling-stone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions. Of these latter, one was too badly<br />weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical<br />monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the well-known Snake<br />Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.<br />Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite width, even though its<br />length along the foothills seemed endless. After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to<br />thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice.<br />The course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the land<br />assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the<br />mist-hazed west.<br />So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the<br />monstrous structures would have been inconceivable. Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on<br />the foothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on<br />foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins, low flying soon<br />disclosed an ampler number of possible landing places. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight<br />would be across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a<br />landing on a smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and<br />favorable take-off later on.<br />It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so<br />comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely<br />lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we<br />discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass,<br />hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist&rsquo;s hammer and chisel,<br />specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment<br />having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground<br />pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope,<br />outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare<br />specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior<br />mazes we might be able to penetrate. This had been brought in case we found some cave system with air<br />quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual rock-chipping method of trail<br />blazing.<br />Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed<br />against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on<br />approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously. True, we had become visually familiar<br />with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering primordial<br />walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago-before any known race of men could<br />have existed - was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic<br />abnormality. Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more<br />difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any<br />task which might fall to our lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the<br />snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge, roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic<br />five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and<br />when at last we were actually able to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had<br />established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our<br />species.<br />This rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from point to point, was built of Jurassic<br />sandstone blocks of irregular size, averaging 6 x 8 feet in surface. There was a row of arched loopholes<br />or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the<br />star and at its inner angles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface. Looking<br />through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, that there were no partitions<br />remaining within, and that there were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior walls - facts<br />we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this rampart and others like it. Though lower parts<br />must have originally existed, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice<br />and snow at this point.<br />We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs,<br />but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor. Our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings<br />in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading<br />down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top. Before we left the<br />rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortar-less Cyclopean masonry with complete<br />bewilderment. We wished that Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have helped<br />us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city<br />and its outskirts were built up.<br />The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through<br />the skyward peaks in the background, was something of which the smallest details will always remain<br />engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and me<br />conceive such optical effects. Between us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous tangle<br />of dark stone towers, its outre and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision. It<br />was a mirage in solid stone, and were it not for the photographs, I would still doubt that such a thing<br />could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined; but the<br />extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.<br />Even the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless variety, preternatural massiveness, and<br />utterly alien exoticism. There were geometrical forms for which an Euclid would scarcely find a name -<br />cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion,<br />shafts with odd bulbous enlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or five-ridged<br />arrangements of mad grotesqueness. As we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts<br />of the ice sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled<br />structures at various heights. Of orderly streets there seemed to be none, the only broad open swath<br />being a mile to the left, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town into the mountains.<br />Our field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures and dot groups to be<br />very prevalent, and we could half imagine what the city must once have looked like - even though most of<br />the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished. As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted<br />lanes and alleys, all of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging<br />masonry or overarching bridges. Now, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy against a<br />westward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was<br />struggling to shine; and when, for a moment, that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the<br />scene into temporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even<br />the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder<br />note of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt,<br />and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had<br />once existed there. Under the glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent.<br />When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the<br />oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again<br />became such that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and<br />began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp - which I resented all<br />the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this<br />morbid survival from nightmare antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one<br />place - where a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner - he insisted that he saw faint traces of ground<br />markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound from<br />some undefined point - a muffled musical piping, he said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain<br />caves, yet somehow disturbingly different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture<br />and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape,<br />and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and<br />dwelt in this unhallowed place.<br />Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead, and we mechanically carried<br />out our program of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented in the masonry. We<br />wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place. Nothing in the<br />great outer walls seemed to date from later than the Jurassic and Comanchian periods, nor was any piece<br />of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene Age. In stark certainty, we were<br />wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least five hundred thousand years, and in all probability<br />even longer.<br />As we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped at all available apertures to<br />study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities. Some were above our reach, whilst others led only<br />into ice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill. One, though spacious and<br />inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of descent. Now and then we<br />had a chance to study the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by the fabulous<br />antiquity implied in the still discernible grain. These things had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and<br />conifers - especially Cretaceous cycads - and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly Tertiary<br />date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be discovered. In the placing of these shutters -<br />whose edges showed the former presence of queer and long-vanished hinges - usage seemed to be<br />varied - some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures. They seemed to<br />have become wedged in place, thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and<br />fastenings.<br />After a time we came across a row of windows - in the bulges of a colossal five-edged cone of<br />undamaged apex - which led into a vast, well-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too<br />high in the room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope with us, but did not wish to bother<br />with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged to-especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were<br />made upon the heart action. This enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and<br />our electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in<br />broad, horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. We took careful<br />note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encountered.<br />Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway about six feet wide and ten<br />feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the<br />present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case<br />one of the floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left<br />facing westward. That across the alley, where the other archway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with<br />no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and<br />the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness.<br />Heaped debris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly easy, yet for a moment we<br />hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this<br />tangle of archaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving<br />building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us. In<br />the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure. The<br />floor beyond was of great slate slabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with<br />sculptured walls.<br />Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the probable complexity of the<br />nest of apartments within, we decided that we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing.<br />Hitherto our compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain range between the towers<br />in our rear, had been enough to prevent our losing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute<br />would be necessary. Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in a<br />bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This<br />method would probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any strong air<br />currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should develop, or if our paper supply should give out, we<br />could of course fall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method of rock chipping.<br />Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess without a trial. The close and<br />frequent connection of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on<br />bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little<br />glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions. Almost all the areas of transparent ice had<br />revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that uniform state<br />until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower part for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a<br />curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim, bygone aeon,<br />rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been<br />foreseen, and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode? The precise<br />physiographic conditions attending the formation of the ice sheet at this point would have to wait for later<br />solution. It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had<br />been responsible, and perhaps some flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial<br />dam in the great range, had helped to create the special state now observable. Imagination could<br />conceive almost anything in connection with this place.<br />VI<br />It would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of our wanderings inside that cavernous,<br />aeon-dead honeycomb of primal masonry - that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the<br />first time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet. This is especially true because so much of<br />the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings. Our<br />flashlight photographs of those carvings will do much toward proving the truth of what we are now<br />disclosing, and it is lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made crude<br />notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used up.<br />The building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness, and gave us an impressive<br />notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive than the<br />outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently preserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving<br />curiously irregular difference in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and we should certainly<br />have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us. We decided to explore the<br />more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred<br />feet, to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky. Ascent<br />was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served<br />in lieu of stairs. The rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions, ranging from<br />five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It might be safe to say that their general average was<br />about 30 x 30 feet in floor area, and 20 feet in height, though many larger apartments existed. After<br />thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level, we descended, story by story, into the<br />submerged part, where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and<br />passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building. The Cyclopean<br />massiveness and gigantism of everything about us became curiously oppressive; and there was something<br />vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and constructional<br />nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon realized, from what the carvings revealed,<br />that this monstrous city was many million years old.<br />We cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous balancing and adjustment of the<br />vast rock masses, though the function of the arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were<br />wholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city&rsquo;s deliberate<br />desertion. The prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which tended<br />to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with<br />bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques. There were exceptions to this rule of<br />arrangement, but its preponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth car-touches<br />containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bands.<br />The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree<br />of civilized mastery, though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race. In<br />delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate<br />vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the<br />carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful intricacy. The arabesques displayed a<br />profound use of mathematical principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles<br />based on the quantity of five. The pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and involved a<br />peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly, notwithstanding the<br />intervening gulf of vast geologic periods. Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the<br />cross section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of<br />any known race of antiquity. It is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums.<br />Those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions<br />of the most daring futurists.<br />The arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose depth on unweathered walls varied<br />from one to two inches. When cartouches with dot groups appeared - evidently as inscriptions in some<br />unknown and primordial language and alphabet - the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an<br />inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps a half inch more. The pictorial bands were in countersunk low<br />relief, their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface. In some<br />specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected, though for the most part the untold aeons had<br />disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied. The more one studied the<br />marvelous technique, the more one admired the things. Beneath their strict conventionalization one could<br />grasp the minute and accurate observation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very<br />conventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real essence or vital differentiation of<br />every object delineated. We felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there were others<br />lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions. Certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent<br />symbols and stimuli which another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or different sensory<br />equipment, might have made of profound and poignant significance to us.<br />The subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished epoch of their creation,<br />and contained a large proportion of evident history. It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the primal<br />race - a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence, miraculously in our favor - which made the<br />carvings so awesomely informative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and<br />transcription above all other considerations. In certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by<br />the presence of maps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs of an enlarged scale - these things<br />giving a naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes and dadoes. In<br />hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account will not arouse a curiosity greater<br />than sane caution on the part of those who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be allured<br />to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage them.<br />Interrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot doorways; both now and<br />then retaining the petrified wooden planks - elaborately carved and polished-of the actual shutters and<br />doors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had to be<br />forced aside as we progressed from room to room. Window frames with odd transparent panes - mostly<br />elliptical - survived here and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also frequent niches of<br />great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green<br />soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal. Other apertures<br />were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilities - heating, lighting, and the like-of a sort<br />suggested in many of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green<br />soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now. Floors were also paved with such tiles, though plain<br />stonework predominated.<br />As I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the<br />strange devices which had once filled these tomblike, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the floors<br />were generally thick with detritus, litter, and debris, but farther down this condition decreased. In some of<br />the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations, while<br />occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or collapses<br />had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones. A central court - as in other structures<br />we had seen from the air - saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had to use our<br />electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details. Below the ice cap, however,<br />the twilight deepened; and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute<br />blackness.<br />To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeon-silent maze of<br />unhuman masonry, one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and<br />impressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm<br />almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp,<br />and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us. The moment we came<br />upon a perfect section of carving, where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief<br />study to give us the hideous truth - a truth which it would be naive to claim Danforth and I had not<br />independently suspected before, though we had carefully refrained from even hinting it to each other.<br />There could now be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and<br />inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years ago, when man&rsquo;s ancestors were primitive archaic<br />mammals, and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and Asia.<br />We had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted - each to himself - that the omnipresence<br />of the five-pointed motifs meant only some cultural or religious exaltation of the Archaean natural object<br />which had so patently embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the decorative motifs of Minoan Crete<br />exalted the sacred bull, those of Egypt the scarabaeus, those of Rome the wolf and the eagle, and those<br />of various savage tribes some chosen totem animal. But this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and<br />we were forced to face definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of these pages has<br />doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to write it down in black and white even now, but<br />perhaps that will not be necessary.<br />The things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of dinosaurs were not indeed<br />dinosaurs, but far worse. Mere dinosaurs were new and almost brainless objects - but the builders of the<br />city were wise and old, and had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down well nigh a thousand<br />million years - rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of cells -<br />rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all. They were the makers and enslavers of<br />that life, and above all doubt the originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the Pnakotic<br />Manuscripts and theNecronomicon affrightedly hint about. They were the great "Old Ones" that had<br />filtered down from the stars when earth was young - the beings whose substance an alien evolution had<br />shaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred. And to think that only the day<br />before Danforth and I had actually looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance - and<br />that poor Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines - It is of course impossible for me to relate<br />in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of prehuman<br />life. After the first shock of the certain revelation, we had to pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully<br />three o&rsquo;clock before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research. The sculptures in the<br />building we entered were of relatively late date - perhaps two million years ago-as checked up by<br />geological, biological, and astronomical features - and embodied an art which would be called decadent<br />in comparison with that of specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial<br />sheet. One edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly even fifty million years -<br />to the lower Eocene or upper Cretaceous - and contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing anything<br />else, with one tremendous exception, that we encountered. That was, we have since agreed, the oldest<br />domestic structure we traversed.<br />Were it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public, I would refrain from telling what I<br />found and inferred, lest I be confined as a madman. Of course, the infinitely early parts of the patchwork<br />tale - representing the preterrestrial life of the star-headed beings on other planets, in other galaxies, and<br />in other universes - can readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings themselves; yet<br />such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of<br />mathematics and astrophysics that I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see the<br />photographs I shall publish.<br />Naturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction of any connected story,<br />nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages of that story in their proper order. Some of the<br />vast rooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned, whilst in other cases a<br />continuous chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors. The best of the maps and<br />diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the ancient ground level - a cavern perhaps<br />two hundred feet square and sixty feet high, which had almost undoubtedly been an educational center of<br />some sort. There were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms and buildings,<br />since certain chapters of experience, and certain summaries or phases of racial history, had evidently<br />been favorites with different decorators or dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant versions of the same<br />theme proved useful in settling debatable points and filling up gaps.<br />I still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal. Of course, we even now have<br />only the barest outline - and much of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and<br />sketches we made. It may be the effect of this later study - the revived memories and vague impressions<br />acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose<br />essence he will not reveal even to me - which has been the immediate source of Danforth&rsquo;s present<br />breakdown. But it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible<br />information, and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity. Certain lingering influences in that<br />unknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make it imperative that further<br />exploration be discouraged.<br />VII<br />The full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an official bulletin of Miskatonic University.<br />Here I shall sketch only the salient highlights in a formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise, the<br />sculptures told of the coming of those star-headed things to the nascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space<br />- their coming, and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark upon spatial<br />pioneering. They seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast membranous wings - thus<br />oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived<br />under the sea a good deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by<br />means of intricate devices employing unknown principles of energy. Evidently their scientific and<br />mechanical knowledge far surpassed man&rsquo;s today, though they made use of its more widespread and<br />elaborate forms only when obliged to. Some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a<br />stage of mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding its effects emotionally<br />unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness of organization and simplicity of natural wants made them<br />peculiarly able to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits of artificial manufacture, and<br />even without garments, except for occasional protection against the elements.<br />It was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes, that they first created earth life - using<br />available substances according to long-known methods. The more elaborate experiments came after the<br />annihilation of various cosmic enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having<br />manufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of molding<br />their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal slaves<br />to perform the heavy work of the community. These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul<br />Alhazred whispered about as the "Shoggoths" in his frightfulNecronomicon, though even that mad Arab<br />had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain<br />alkaloidal herb. When the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms<br />and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of<br />animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became troublesome.<br />With the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights, the small, low<br />cities under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on<br />land. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe, and<br />probably retained many traditions of land construction. As we studied the architecture of all these<br />sculptured palaeogean cities, including that whose aeon-dead corridors we were even then traversing, we<br />were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. The<br />tops of the buildings, which in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into shapeless<br />ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs, and showed vast clusters of needle-like spires,<br />delicate finials on certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal scalloped disks capping<br />cylindrical shafts. This was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous mirage, cast by a<br />dead city whence such skyline features had been absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years,<br />which loomed on our ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first approached<br />poor Lake&rsquo;s ill-fated camp.<br />Of the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them migrated to land, volumes could be<br />written. Those in shallow water had continued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main<br />head tentacles, and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual way - the writing<br />accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces. Those lower down in the ocean depths,<br />though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to furnish light, pieced out their vision with obscure<br />special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their heads - senses which rendered all the Old<br />Ones partly independent of light in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and writing had changed<br />curiously during the descent, embodying certain apparently chemical coating processes - probably to<br />secure phosphorescence - which the basreliefs could not make clear to us. The beings moved in the sea<br />partly by swimming - using the lateral crinoid arms - and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of<br />tentacles containing the pseudofeet. Occasionally they accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use<br />of two or more sets of their fanlike folding wings. On land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and<br />then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings. The many slender tentacles into which<br />the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate, flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous<br />coordination - ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operations.<br />The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific pressure of the deepest sea bottoms<br />appeared powerless to harm them. Very few seemed to die at all except by violence, and their burial<br />places were very limited. The fact that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed<br />inscribed mounds set up thoughts in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation<br />necessary after the sculptures revealed it. The beings multiplied by means of spores - like vegetable<br />pteridophytes, as Lake had suspected - but, owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity, and<br />consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new<br />prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize. The young matured swiftly, and received an<br />education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine. The prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was<br />highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which I shall describe<br />more fully in my coming monograph. These varied slightly according to sea or land residence, but had the<br />same foundations and essentials.<br />Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances, they vastly preferred<br />organic and especially animal food. They ate uncooked marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands<br />on land. They hunted game and raised meat herds - slaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks<br />on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted. They resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously,<br />and in their natural state could live in water down to freezing. When the great chill of the Pleistocene drew<br />on, however - nearly a million years ago-the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including<br />artificial heating - until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back into the sea. For their<br />prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they absorbed certain chemicals and became almost<br />independent of eating, breathing, or heat conditions - but by the time of the great cold they had lost track<br />of the method. In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm.<br />Being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological basis for the family<br />phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize large households on the principles of comfortable<br />space-utility and - as we deduced from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers -<br />congenial mental association. In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge<br />rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in the case of the land<br />inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably electro-chemical in nature. Both on land and under<br />water they used curious tables, chairs and couches like cylindrical frames - for they rested and slept<br />upright with folded-down tentacles - and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their books.<br />Government was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no certainties in this regard could be<br />deduced from the sculptures we saw. There was extensive commerce, both local and between different<br />cities - certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller of<br />the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency. Though the<br />culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock raising existed. Mining and a limited amount<br />of manufacturing were also practiced. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed<br />relatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded. For personal<br />locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air, and water movement alike the Old Ones seemed<br />to possess excessively vast capacities for speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of burden -<br />Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existence.<br />These vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms - animal and vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and<br />aerial - were the products of unguided evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but escaping<br />beyond their radius of attention. They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not<br />come in conflict with the dominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically<br />exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling,<br />primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers,<br />whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of land cities the<br />huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species<br />heretofore unknown to paleontology.<br />The persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the<br />earth&rsquo;s crust was little short of miraculous. Though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained<br />beyond the Archaean Age, there was no interruption in their civilization or in the transmission of their<br />records. Their original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean, and it is likely that they<br />came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighboring South Pacific.<br />According to one of the sculptured maps the whole globe was then under water, with stone cities<br />scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed. Another map shows a vast bulk of dry<br />land around the south pole, where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements,<br />though their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom. Later maps, which display the land<br />mass as cracking and drifting, and sending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the<br />theories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and Joly.<br />With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began. Some of the marine cities<br />were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst misfortune. Another race - a land race of beings<br />shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to fabulous prehuman spawn of Cthulhu - soon began<br />filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a -monstrous war which for a time drove the Old<br />Ones wholly back to the sea - a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements. Later peace<br />was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the<br />older lands. New land cities were founded - the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this region of first<br />arrival was sacred. From then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old Ones&rsquo;<br />civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out. Then suddenly the lands<br />of the Pacific sank again, taking with them the frightful stone city of R&rsquo;lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so<br />that the Old Ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did<br />not like to speak. At a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globe - hence<br />the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make systematic borings with<br />Pabodie&rsquo;s type of apparatus in certain widely separated regions.<br />The steady trend down the ages was from water to land - a movement encouraged by the rise of new<br />land masses, though the ocean was never wholly deserted. Another cause of the landward movement<br />was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended.<br />With the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of creating new life from inorganic<br />matter had been lost, so that the Old Ones had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence.<br />On land the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission<br />and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.<br />They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of the Old Ones, and had modeled<br />their tough plasticity into various useful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers<br />were sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion.<br />They had, it seems, developed a semistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition<br />echoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it. Sculptured images of these Shoggoths filled<br />Danforth and me with horror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed of a viscous<br />jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and each averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when<br />a sphere. They had, however, a constantly shifting shape and volume - throwing out temporary<br />developments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech in imitation of their masters, either<br />spontaneously or according to suggestion.<br />They seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the Permian Age, perhaps one<br />hundred and fifty million years ago, when a veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the<br />marine Old Ones. Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion in which the Shoggoths<br />typically left their slain victims, held a marvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold<br />ages. The Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular and atomic disturbances against the rebel<br />entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory. Thereafter the sculptures showed a period in<br />which Shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west<br />were tamed by cowboys. Though during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to live out of<br />water, this transition was not encouraged - since their usefulness on land would hardly have been<br />commensurate with the trouble of their management.<br />During the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer space<br />- this time by half-fungous, half-crustacean creatures - creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in<br />certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or<br />abominable Snow Men. To fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time since their<br />terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary ether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found<br />it no longer possible to leave the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had<br />been, it was now definitely lost to the race. In the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the<br />northern lands, though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little by little the slow retreat of<br />the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginning.<br />It was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu spawn and the Mi-Go seem to have<br />been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the<br />Old Ones. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries,<br />and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of the cosmic space. The Old Ones,<br />but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties, were strictly material, and must have had<br />their absolute origin within the known space-time continuum - whereas the first sources of the other<br />beings can only be guessed at with bated breath. All this, of course, assuming that the non-terrestrial<br />linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology. Conceivably, the Old<br />Ones might have invented a cosmic framework to account for their occasional defeats, since historical<br />interest and pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is significant that their annals<br />failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering cities<br />figure persistently in certain obscure legends.<br />The changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with startling vividness in many of<br />the sculptured maps and scenes. In certain cases existing science will require revision, while in other<br />cases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed. As I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener,<br />and Joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which cracked from<br />centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower surface - an hypothesis suggested by<br />such things as the complementary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the great mountain<br />chains are rolled and shoved up - receives striking support from this uncanny source.<br />Maps evidently showing the Carboniferous world of an hundred million or more years ago displayed<br />significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe<br />(then the Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic continent. Other charts - and<br />most significantly one in connection with the founding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around<br />us - showed all the present continents well differentiated. And in the latest discoverable specimen - dating<br />perhaps from the Pliocene Age - the approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the<br />linkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through Greenland, and of South America<br />with the antarctic continent through Graham Land. In the Carboniferous map the whole globe-ocean floor<br />and rifted land mass alike - bore symbols of the Old Ones&rsquo; vast stone cities, but in the later charts the<br />gradual recession toward the antarctic became very plain. The final Pliocene specimen showed no land<br />cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean cities north of the<br />fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. Knowledge and interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast<br />lines probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membranous wings, had evidently<br />declined to zero among the Old Ones.<br />Destruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains, the centrifugal rending of continents, the seismic<br />convulsions of land or sea bottom, and other natural causes, was a matter of common record; and it was<br />curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on. The vast dead<br />megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general center of the race - built early in the<br />Cretaceous Age after a titanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant. It<br />appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all, where reputedly the first Old Ones had<br />settled on a primal sea bottom. In the new city - many of whose features we could recognize in the<br />sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles along the mountain range in each direction beyond<br />the farthest limits of our aerial survey - there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming<br />part of the first sea-bottom city, which thrust up to light after long epochs in the course of the general<br />crumbling of strata.<br />VIII<br />Naturally, Danforth and I studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything<br />pertaining to the immediate district in which we were. Of this local material there was naturally a vast<br />abundance; and on the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very late<br />date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a neighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent<br />workmanship carrying the story of the region much beyond the period of the Pliocene map whence we<br />derived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the last place we examined in detail,<br />since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objective.<br />Certainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible of all the corners of earth&rsquo;s globe.<br />Of all existing lands, it was infinitely the most ancient. The conviction grew upon us that this hideous<br />upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of Leng which even the mad author of the<br />Necronomicon was reluctant to discuss. The great mountain chain was tremendously long - starting as a<br />low range at Luitpold Land on the east coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the entire continent.<br />That really high part stretched in a mighty arc from about Latitude 82&deg;, E. Longitude 60&deg; to Latitude 70&deg;,<br />E. Longitude 115&deg;, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long,<br />ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by Wilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.<br />Yet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at hand. I have said that<br />these peaks are higher than the Himalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth&rsquo;s<br />highest. That grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to<br />record at all, whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation. It seems that there<br />was one part of the ancient land - the first part that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off<br />the moon and the Old Ones had seeped down, from the stars - which had come to be shunned as<br />vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled before their time, and had been found<br />suddenly deserted. Then when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in the Comanchian<br />Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaos - and earth<br />had received her loftiest and most terrible mountains.<br />If the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must have been much over forty thousand<br />feet high - radically vaster than even the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended,<br />it appeared, from about Latitude 77&deg;, E. Longitude 70&deg; to Latitude 70&deg;, E. Longitude 100&deg; - less than<br />three hundred miles away from the dead city, so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the<br />dim western distance had it not been for that vague, opalescent haze. Their northern end must likewise be<br />visible from the long antarctic circle coast line at Queen Mary Land.<br />Some of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those mountains - but none<br />ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond. No human eye had ever seen them, and as I<br />studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings, I prayed that none ever might. There are protecting hills<br />along the coast beyond them - Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands - and I thank Heaven no one has<br />been able to land and climb those hills. I am not as sceptical about old tales and fears as I used to be,<br />and I do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptor&rsquo;s notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then<br />at each of the brooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible pinnacles all<br />through the long polar night. There may be a very real and very monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic<br />whispers about Kadath in the Cold Waste.<br />But the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less namelessly accursed. Soon after the<br />founding of the city the great mountain range became the seat of the principal temples, and many carvings<br />showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously<br />clinging cubes and ramparts. In the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into<br />adjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later epochs, all the limestone veins of the region were<br />hollowed out by ground waters, so that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were a<br />veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep<br />underground, and of the final discovery of the Stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth&rsquo;s bowels.<br />This vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the<br />nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones&rsquo;<br />range and flowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes&rsquo;s<br />coast line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping<br />currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss. Finally<br />its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later<br />city as we now found it had been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what had<br />happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands<br />of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darkness.<br />This river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one whose extinct course we<br />had seen in our aeroplane survey. Its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves<br />to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region&rsquo;s age-long, aeon-dead history, so that we were<br />able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features - squares, important buildings, and the like -<br />for guidance in further explorations. We could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it<br />was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings<br />and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had<br />looked like. It must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of it, I almost forgot the<br />clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the city&rsquo;s inhuman age and massiveness and deadness<br />and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit. Yet according to certain<br />carvings, the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a<br />somber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in the act of recoiling affrightedly<br />from some object - never allowed to appear in the design - found in the great river and indicated as<br />having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those horrible westward<br />mountains.<br />It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of<br />the final calamity leading to the city&rsquo;s desertion. Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of<br />the same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and<br />uncertain period; indeed, very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward.<br />But this was the first and only set we directly encountered. We meant to look farther later on; but as I<br />have said, immediate conditions dictated another present objective. There would, though, have been a<br />limit - for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the Old Ones, there<br />could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate blow, of course, was the<br />coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall, and which has never departed from<br />the ill-fated poles - the great cold that, at the world&rsquo;s other extremity, put an end to the fabled lands of<br />Lomar and Hyperborea.<br />Just when this tendency began in the antarctic, it would be hard to say in terms of exact years. Nowadays<br />we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years<br />from the present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier. All<br />quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made<br />considerably less than a million years ago, and that the actual desertion of the city was complete long<br />before the conventional opening of the Pleistocene - five hundred thousand years ago - as reckoned in<br />terms of the earth&rsquo;s whole surface.<br />In the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere, and of a decreased country<br />life on the part of the Old Ones. Heating devices were shown in the houses, and winter travelers were<br />represented as muffled in protective fabrics. Then we saw a series of cartouches - the continuous band<br />arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings - depicting a constantly growing migration<br />to the nearest refuges of greater warmth - some fleeing to cities under the sea off the far-away coast, and<br />some clambering down through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighboring black<br />abyss of subterrene waters.<br />In the end it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received the greatest colonization. This was<br />partly due, no doubt, to the traditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more<br />conclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the<br />honeycombed mountains, and for retaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of<br />communication with various mines. The linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by<br />means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes, including the chiseling of<br />numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss - sharply down-pointing tunnels<br />whose mouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates, on the guide map we were<br />compiling. It was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of<br />where we were - both being on the mountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter of a mile<br />toward the ancient river course, and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite direction.<br />The abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places, but the Old Ones built their new<br />city under water - no doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden<br />sea appears to have been very great, so that the earth&rsquo;s internal heat could ensure its habitability for an<br />indefinite period. The beings seemed to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to part-time - and<br />eventually, of course, whole-time - residence under water, since they had never allowed their gill systems<br />to atrophy. There were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently visited their<br />submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great<br />river. The darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long<br />antarctic nights.<br />Decadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they<br />told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea. The Old Ones had gone about it scientifically -<br />quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains, and employing expert workers<br />from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods. These<br />workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new venture - Shoggoth tissue from<br />which to breed stone lifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic<br />matter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.<br />At last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea, its architecture much like that of the<br />city above, and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical<br />element inherent in building operations. The newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular<br />intelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvelous quickness. They<br />seemed to converse with the Old Ones by mimicking their voices - a sort of musical piping over a wide<br />range, if poor Lake&rsquo;s dissection had indicated aright - and to work more from spoken commands than<br />from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times. They were, however, kept in admirable control. The<br />phosphorescent organisms supplied light With vast effectiveness, and doubtless atoned for the loss of the<br />familiar polar auroras of the outer-world night.<br />Art and decoration were pursued, though of course with a certain decadence. The Old Ones seemed to<br />realize this falling off themselves, and in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by<br />transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city, just as the emperor, in a similar<br />age of decline, stripped Greece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital greater<br />splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more<br />extensive was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned. By the<br />time total abandonment did occur - and it surely must have occurred before the polar Pleistocene was far<br />advanced - the Old Ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art - or had ceased to<br />recognize the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate, the aeon-silent ruins around us had<br />certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other<br />movables, had been taken away.<br />The decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were, as I have said, the latest we could find in our<br />limited search. They left us with a picture of the Old Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in<br />summer and the sea-cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading with the sea-bottom cities off the<br />antarctic coast. By this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognized, for the<br />sculptures showed many signs of the cold&rsquo;s malign encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the<br />terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saunan livestock were<br />nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper<br />world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant Shoggoths<br />to land life - a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and<br />the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown away,<br />save only the great, grotesque penguins.<br />What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-cavern city survived?<br />Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last?<br />To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones<br />shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap? Existing geology shows no trace of their presence. Had the<br />frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might<br />or might not linger, even to this day, in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth&rsquo;s deepest waters?<br />Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure - and men of the sea have<br />fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and<br />mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk?<br />The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved<br />them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city&rsquo;s history. They were,<br />according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and we reflected that in their day<br />the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had had no existence. They would have remembered an<br />older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them,<br />and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic<br />ocean.<br />And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens - especially about the eight perfect ones that<br />were missing from Lake&rsquo;s hideously ravaged camp. There was something abnormal about that whole<br />business - the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody&rsquo;s madness - those frightful graves -<br />the amount and nature of the missing material - Gedney - the unearthly toughness of those archaic<br />monstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed the race to have - Danforth and I<br />had seen a good deal in the last few hours, and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many<br />appalling and incredible secrets of primal nature.<br />IX<br />I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our immediate objective.<br />This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to the black inner world, of whose existence we had<br />not known before, but which we were now eager to find and traverse. From the evident scale of the<br />carvings we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring<br />tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about the great abyss; down whose sides<br />paths, improved by the Old Ones, led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this<br />fabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of the thing<br />- yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.<br />It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever.<br />We had done so much studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at<br />least five hours of nearly continuous use, and despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be<br />good for only about four more - though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or<br />difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that. It would not do to be without a<br />light in these Cyclopean catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further<br />mural deciphering. Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive<br />study and photography - curiosity having long ago got the better of horror - but just now we must hasten.<br />Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare<br />notebooks or sketching paper to augment it, but we did let one large notebook go. If worse came to<br />worst we could resort to rock chipping - and of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost<br />direction, to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial<br />and error. So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel.<br />According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel mouth could not be<br />much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood; the intervening space showing solid-looking<br />buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial level. The opening itself would be in the<br />basement - on the angle nearest the foothills - of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and<br />perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our aerial survey of the ruins.<br />No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded that its upper parts<br />had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter<br />case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one<br />- the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more<br />southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring ones were choked it was doubtful<br />whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one - about a mile beyond our<br />second choice.<br />As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass - traversing rooms<br />and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and<br />bridges and clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now<br />and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our<br />way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while striking the bottom of<br />an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down - we were repeatedly tantalized by the<br />sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense historical importance, and only<br />the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by. As it was, we slowed down<br />once in a while and turned on our second torch. If we had had more films, we would certainly have<br />paused briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was clearly out of the<br />question.<br />I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather than state, is very<br />strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further<br />exploration. We had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel&rsquo;s mouth - having<br />crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a<br />ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late<br />workmanship - when, shortly before 8:30 P.M., Danforth&rsquo;s keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of<br />something unusual. If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At first<br />we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds<br />our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching. There was an<br />odor - and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening<br />the insane grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected.<br />Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now. There were several<br />conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering. Most important of all, we did<br />not retreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything<br />short of certain disaster. Anyway, what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe. Such<br />things did not happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim<br />our single torch - tempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from<br />the oppressive walls - and which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the<br />increasingly littered floor and heaps of debris.<br />Danforth&rsquo;s eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was likewise he who first noticed the<br />queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many half-choked arches leading to chambers and<br />corridors on the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of<br />desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have<br />been lately tracked through it. The irregular nature of the litter precluded any definite marks, but in the<br />smoother places there were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a<br />hint of parallel tracks as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.<br />It was during that pause that we caught - simultaneously this time - the other odor ahead. Paradoxically, it<br />was both a less frightful and more frightful odor - less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this<br />place under the known circumstances - unless, of course, Gedney - for the odor was the plain and<br />familiar one of common petrol - every-day gasoline.<br />Our motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists. We knew now that some terrible<br />extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this nighted burial place of the aeons, hence could<br />not doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditions - present or at least recent just ahead. Yet in<br />the end we did let sheer burning curiosity-or anxiety-or autohypnotism - or vague thoughts of<br />responsibility toward Gedney - or what not - drive us on. Danforth whispered again of the print he<br />thought he had seen at the alley turning in the ruins above; and of the faint musical piping - potentially of<br />tremendous significance in the light of Lake&rsquo;s dissection report, despite its close resemblance to the<br />cave-mouth echoes of the windy peaks - which he thought he had shortly afterward half heard from<br />unknown depths below. I, in my turn, whispered of how the camp was left - of what had disappeared,<br />and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have conceived the inconceivable - a wild trip across<br />the monstrous mountains and a descent into the unknown, primal masonry - But we could not convince<br />each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite. We had turned off all light as we stood still, and<br />vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute. Having<br />automatically begun to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch. The<br />disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew stronger.<br />More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until very soon we saw that the forward way<br />was about to cease. We had been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the<br />air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out<br />of which the abyssward aperture opened.<br />The torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood, showed<br />several doorways in various states of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor-quite<br />submerging that other hint of odor - came with especial distinctness. As we looked more steadily, we<br />saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from that particular<br />opening. Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue toward it was now plainly<br />manifest. I do not think anyone will wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further<br />motion.<br />And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was one of anticlimax. For<br />amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured Crypt - a perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet -<br />there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in<br />vain, for a farther doorway. In another moment, however, Danforth&rsquo;s sharp vision had descried a place<br />where the floor debris had been disturbed; and we turned on both torches full strength. Though what we<br />saw in that light was actually simple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it<br />implied. It was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered,<br />and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to<br />leave a strong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude. In other words, it could not be other than<br />a sort of camp - a camp made by questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by the<br />unexpectedly choked way to the abyss.<br />Let me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned, all from Lake&rsquo;s camp;<br />and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent<br />matches, three illustrated books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and<br />instructional carton, a broken fountain pen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth, a used<br />electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with our type of tent heater, and a sprinkling<br />of crumpled papers. It was all bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what<br />was on them, we felt we had come to the worst. We had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the<br />camp which might have prepared us, yet the effect of the sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a<br />nightmare city was almost too much to bear.<br />A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish<br />soapstones, just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and he<br />might conceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches - varying in their accuracy or lack of it - which<br />outlined the neighboring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside<br />our previous route - a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular<br />gulf glimpsed in our aerial survey - to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth therein.<br />He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite obviously compiled, as<br />our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the ones<br />which we had seen and used. But what the art-blind bungler could never have done was to execute those<br />sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of<br />the decadent carvings from which they were taken - the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the<br />Old Ones themselves in the dead city&rsquo;s heyday.<br />There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that; since our<br />conclusions were now - notwithstanding their wildness - completely fixed, and of a nature I need not<br />even mention to those who have read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were mad - for have I not<br />said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of the same<br />spirit - albeit in a less extreme form - in the men who stalk deadly beasts through African jungles to<br />photograph them or study their habits. Half paralyzed with terror though we were, there was nevertheless<br />fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end.<br />Of course we did not mean to face that - or those - which we knew had been there, but we felt that they<br />must be gone by now. They would by this time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss,<br />and have passed within, to whatever night-black fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate<br />gulf - the ultimate gulf they had never seen. Or if that entrance, too, was blocked, they would have gone<br />on to the north seeking another. They were, we remembered, partly independent of light.<br />Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our new emotions took - just<br />what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did<br />not mean to face what we feared - yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish<br />to spy certain things from some hidden vantage point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse<br />the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shown on<br />the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at once recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower<br />figuring in the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above.<br />Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its<br />subglacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural<br />marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in<br />which it figured - being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not<br />but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good present link with the upper world - a shorter<br />route than the one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended.<br />At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches - which quite perfectly confirmed our own<br />- and start back over the indicated course to the circular place; the course which our nameless<br />predecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighboring gate to the abyss would lie<br />beyond that. I need not speak of our journey - during which we continued to leave an economical trail of<br />paper - for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that<br />it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now<br />and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot; and after we had<br />passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly conscious - spasmodically - of that<br />more hideous and more persistent scent. After the way had branched from our former course, we<br />sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case<br />the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the<br />Old Ones.<br />About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a long, vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed<br />somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong<br />daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular<br />place, and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor ended in an arch<br />surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged.<br />Beyond there stretched a prodigious round space - fully two hundred feet in diameter - strewn with<br />debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross. The<br />walls were - in available spaces - boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions; and<br />displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far<br />beyond anything we had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we<br />fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth.<br />But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn<br />outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart<br />of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity of<br />our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower&rsquo;s inner wall, had prevented<br />our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level.<br />Pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could<br />merely admire and marvel. We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we<br />saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently preserved up to the present<br />top of the tower - a highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure - and its shelter had done<br />much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.<br />As we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous cylinder bottom - fifty million years<br />old, and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes - we saw that the<br />ramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our aerial<br />survey, meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane<br />had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled masonry, somewhat sheltered<br />for three-fourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to<br />the sculptures, the original tower had stood in the center of an immense circular plaza, and had been<br />perhaps five hundred or six hundred feet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of<br />needlelike spires along the upper rim. Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than<br />inward - a fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole<br />interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the<br />archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently cleared.<br />It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had<br />descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we<br />had left elsewhere. The tower&rsquo;s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was<br />the great terraced building we had entered, and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this<br />trip would lie in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips - even after all<br />we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there<br />came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters.<br />It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp&rsquo;s lower and<br />outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view. There they were - the three<br />sledges missing from Lake&rsquo;s camp - shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging<br />along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly<br />unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and contained things<br />memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins<br />obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with less obvious contents - everything derived from<br />Lake&rsquo;s equipment.<br />Alfer what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this encounter. The<br />really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly<br />disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for<br />there were two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some<br />wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent further damage. They were<br />the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog.<br />X<br />Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and<br />the abyss so soon after our somber discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have<br />immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a<br />whole new train of speculations. We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing in a<br />kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousness - the first sounds we had<br />heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights.<br />Well-known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of death was more<br />unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones &lsquo;could possibly have been - since they<br />gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony.<br />Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which Lake&rsquo;s dissection report<br />had led us to expect in those others - and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading into<br />every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror - it would have had a kind of hellish<br />congruity with the aeon-dead region around us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of<br />other epochs. As it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustments - all our tacit<br />acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life.<br />What we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal<br />toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so<br />mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at<br />McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be. To be brief -<br />it was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin.<br />The muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had come<br />- regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water<br />bird in such a direction - in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness - could<br />lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It<br />was, indeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat. Seeking its source, we<br />entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail blazing - with an added<br />paper supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the sledges - when we<br />left daylight behind.<br />As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some curious, dragging<br />tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too<br />superfluous. The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass<br />prescribed as an approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless<br />thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open. The tunnel, according to the chart, ought<br />to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our<br />aerial survey as remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single torch showed a customary<br />profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to examine any of these.<br />Suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the second torch. It is odd how<br />wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones,<br />having left their supplies in the great circular place, must have planned to return after their scouting trip<br />toward or into the abyss; yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as if they<br />had never existed. This white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to realize at once that<br />it was not one of those others. They were larger and dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion<br />over land surfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their sea-born tentacle<br />equipment. But to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed<br />clutched for an instant by primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding<br />those others. Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to<br />join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin - albeit of a<br />huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its<br />combined albinism and virtual eyelessness.<br />When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and<br />unheeding group of three, we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic<br />species. Their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones&rsquo; sculptures,<br />and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock-undoubtedly<br />surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their<br />pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits. That their present habitat was the vast abyss<br />we sought, was not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf&rsquo;s continued warmth and<br />habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies.<br />We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain. The state and<br />silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst<br />the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those<br />others should have startled them. Was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or<br />t-ried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent odor which the dogs had hated<br />could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins, since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent<br />terms with the Old Ones - an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long<br />as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting - in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science - that we<br />could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on<br />toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction<br />occasional penguin tracks made clear.<br />Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us<br />to believe that we were approaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins, and<br />heard others immediately ahead. Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us<br />gasp involuntarily - a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully a hundred feet in<br />diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and<br />that one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a<br />height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss.<br />In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of<br />the primordial celestial dome, a few albino penguins waddled - aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.<br />The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade, its aperture adorned with<br />grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer<br />air, and perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than<br />penguins the limitless void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains,<br />might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected by poor<br />Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not<br />be caused by the tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed regions of earth&rsquo;s<br />core.<br />Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was - at least at the start - about fifteen feet each way - sides,<br />floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely decorated<br />with cartouches of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and carving<br />were marvelously well-preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing outgoing<br />penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these others. The farther one advanced, the warmer it became;<br />so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any actually<br />igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot. Alter a short distance<br />the masonry gave place to solid rock, though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the<br />same aspect of carved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut<br />in the floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams;<br />none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible<br />refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss. The nameless scent of such<br />things was very distinct. Doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known<br />conditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspect - indeed, it was<br />just such a lure which had brought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place. We saw several<br />penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse. The carvings<br />had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous wanderings had<br />shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended on.<br />Alter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and we kept very careful<br />track of the various lateral openings we passed. There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was<br />doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were<br />not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of<br />furs and tent cloth taken from Lake&rsquo;s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which<br />the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and<br />number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher<br />foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and<br />scarcely less offensive odor - of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying<br />organisms and perhaps unknown subterranean fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for<br />which the carvings had not prepared us - a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical<br />cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five feet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side<br />passages leading away into cryptical darkness.<br />Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been<br />formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were<br />rough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed<br />off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent. Except for the<br />avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from<br />it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new fetor which<br />had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all<br />trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck<br />us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered.<br />The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-droppings<br />there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave mouths.<br />Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop; for<br />dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam<br />of torchlight over the tunnel walls - and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change<br />which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage. We realized, of course, the great<br />decadence of the Old Ones&rsquo; sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior<br />workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us. But now, in this deeper section beyond the<br />cavern, there was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanation - a difference in basic nature as<br />well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the<br />hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it.<br />This new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail. It was<br />countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse car-touches of<br />the earlier sections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface. Danforth had<br />the idea that it was a second carving - a sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous<br />design. In nature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of crude spirals and angles<br />roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of the Old Ones, yet seemingly more like a parody<br />than a perpetuation of that tradition. We could not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly<br />alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling behind the technique - an alien element, Danforth<br />guessed, that was responsible for the laborious substitution. It was like, yet disturbingly unlike, what we<br />had come to recognize as the Old Ones&rsquo; art; and I was persistently reminded of such hybrid things as the<br />ungainly Palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the Roman manner. That others had recently noticed this belt<br />of carving was hinted by the presence of a used flashlight battery on the floor in front of one of the most<br />characteristic cartouches.<br />Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our advance after a<br />cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes<br />developed. Nothing of the sort was perceived, though the carvings were in places rather sparse because<br />of the numerous mouths of smooth-floored lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer penguins, but<br />thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the<br />earth. The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that<br />other nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature, and the<br />relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the great abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain<br />obstructions on the polished floor ahead - obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins - and<br />turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary.<br />XI<br />Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I ought to be hardened by<br />this stage; but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and<br />leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I have<br />said, certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed<br />almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing fetor, now quite plainly<br />mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before. The light of the second torch left<br />no doubt of what the obstructions were, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even<br />from a distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens<br />unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded graves at poor Lake&rsquo;s camp.<br />They were, indeed, as lacking - in completeness as most of those we had unearthed - though it grew<br />plain from the thick, dark green pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely<br />greater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake&rsquo;s bulletins would have suggested<br />no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly<br />unexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the dark.<br />Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears now made certain the<br />existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous<br />pursuit? The obstructions did not suggest it, for penguins&rsquo; beaks against the tough tissues Lake had<br />dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make<br />out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.<br />Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four responsible? If so, where<br />were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us? We glanced<br />anxiously at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant<br />approach. Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had frightened the penguins into their<br />unaccustomed wandering. It must, then, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf<br />beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here. Perhaps, we reflected, there<br />had been a hideous running fight, with the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when<br />their pursuers finished them. One could picture the demoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities<br />as it surged out of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.<br />I say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly. Would to<br />Heaven we had never approached them at all, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous<br />tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had<br />superseded-run back, before we had seen what we did see, and before our minds were burned with<br />something which will never let us breathe easily again!<br />Both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we soon realized the dominant factor in<br />their incompleteness. Mauled, compressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common injury<br />was total decapitation. From each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as we drew<br />near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction than like any<br />ordinary form of cleavage. Their noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pOOl; but its<br />stench was half overshadowed by the newer and stranger stench, here more pungent than at any other<br />point along our route. Only when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace<br />that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source - and the instant we did so Danforth,<br />remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the Old Ones&rsquo; history in the Permian Age one hundred and<br />fifty million years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted<br />and archaic passage with the evil, palimpsest carvings.<br />I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal sculptures, too, and had<br />shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on<br />certain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones - those whom the frightful Shoggoths had characteristically<br />slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation. They were infamous,<br />nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old, bygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not<br />to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any beings. The mad author of theNecronomicon had<br />nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had<br />even conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes<br />- viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells - rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile -<br />slaves of suggestion, builders of cities - more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more<br />amphibious, more and more imitative! Great God! What madness made even those blasphemous Old<br />Ones willing to use and carve such things?<br />And now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and reflectively iridescent black slime which<br />clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose cause<br />only a diseased fancy could envisage - clung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth<br />part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped dots - we understood the quality of cosmic<br />fear to its uttermost depths. It was not fear of those four missing others - for all too well did we suspect<br />they would do no harm again. Poor devils! Alter all, they were not evil things of their kind. They were the<br />men of another age and another order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on them - as it will on<br />any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may hereafter dig up in that hideously dead or<br />sleeping polar waste - and this was their tragic homecoming. They had not been even savages-for what<br />indeed had they done? That awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch - perhaps an attack by<br />the furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against them and the equally frantic white<br />simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia ... poor Lake, poor Gedney... and poor Old Ones!<br />Scientists to the last - what had they done that we would not have done in their place? God, what<br />intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the incredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears<br />had faced things only a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star spawn - whatever<br />they had been, they were men!<br />They had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once worshipped and roamed among<br />the tree ferns. They had found their dead city brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter<br />days as we had done. They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they had<br />never seen - and what had they found? All this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me<br />as we looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the<br />diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on the wall beside them - looked and understood what must have<br />triumphed and survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted, penguin-fringed abyss,<br />whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth&rsquo;s<br />hysterical scream.<br />The shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us into mute, motionless<br />statues, and it is only through later conversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our<br />thoughts at that moment. It seemed aeons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been more<br />than ten or fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by some remoter<br />advancing bulk-and then came a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so doing<br />broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking, confused penguins over our former trail<br />back to the city, along ice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that archaic spiral<br />ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer air and light of day.<br />The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was what poor Lake&rsquo;s<br />dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely<br />what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial<br />level; and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around the lofty<br />mountain caves. At the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if only because of the<br />surprising way Danforth&rsquo;s impressions chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us<br />both to make the interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and<br />forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when writing hisArthur Gordon Pym a century<br />ago. It will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and<br />prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally<br />snowy birds of that malign region&rsquo;s core."Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" That, I may admit, is exactly what we<br />thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mist-that insidious musical<br />piping over a singularly wide range.<br />We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we knew that the swiftness<br />of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in<br />a moment if it really wished to do so. We had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a<br />display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture, if only from scientific<br />curiosity. Alter all, if such an one had nothing to fear for itself, it would have no motive in harming us.<br />Concealment being futile at this juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived<br />that the mist was thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of those others? Again<br />came that insidious musical piping-"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" Then, noting that we were actually gaining on<br />our pursuer, it occurred to us that the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances, however,<br />since it was very obviously approaching in answer to Danforth&rsquo;s scream, rather than in flight from any<br />other entity. The timing was too close to admit of doubt. Of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and<br />less mentionable nightmare - that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm whose race<br />had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of the hills -<br />we could form no guess; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old One-perhaps a<br />lone survivor - to the peril of recapture and a nameless fate.<br />Thank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened again, and was driving ahead<br />with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and<br />displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed<br />them. Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping -"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" We had been wrong.<br />The thing was not wounded, but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and<br />the hellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that demon message was - but those<br />burials at Lake&rsquo;s camp had shown how much importance the beings attached to their dead. Our<br />recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged,<br />and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculptures - almost felt even when scarcely<br />seen-behind. Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our<br />pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the<br />open space, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of<br />unaccountability. If at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of traveling need, keeping it<br />strictly in front of us, the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our<br />footfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead. Amidst the churning, spiraling fog, the<br />littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other morbidly<br />polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature; even, so far as we could conjecture,<br />for those indicated special senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly, independent of<br />light in emergencies. In fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste.<br />For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on toward the dead city; since the consequences of loss<br />in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.<br />The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we<br />providentially hit on the right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the<br />mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate kept the curling vapors thick enough at the right<br />moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish. Indeed, they did lift for a second just<br />before we emerged from the nauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually caught one<br />first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final, desperately fearful glance backward<br />before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If the fate which<br />screened us was benign, that which gave us the half glimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of<br />semivision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.<br />Our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued<br />to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a<br />subconscious question raised by one of our senses. In the midst of our flight, with all our faculties<br />centered on the problem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze details; yet even so,<br />our latent brain cells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils. Alterward we<br />realized what it was-that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless obstructions, and the<br />coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic<br />called for. In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable fetor had been<br />wholly dominant; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated<br />with those others. This it had not done - for instead, the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually<br />undiluted, and growing more and more poisonously insistent each second.<br />So we glanced back simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the incipient motion of one<br />prompted the imitation of the other. As we did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily<br />thinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally<br />unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the<br />labyrinth center ahead. Unhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot&rsquo;s wife, paid much more dearly for a<br />backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged piping -"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"<br />I might as well be frank - even if I cannot bear to be quite direct - in stating what we saw; though at the<br />time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other. The words reaching the reader can never<br />even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself. It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder<br />we had the residual sense to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead<br />city. Instinct alone must have carried us through - perhaps better than reason could have done; though if<br />that was what saved us, we paid a high price. Of reason we certainly had little enough left.<br />Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the journey was hearing him<br />lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I alone of mankind could have found anything but<br />insane irrelevance. It reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated<br />through the vaultings ahead, and-thank God-through the now empty vaultings behind. He could not have<br />begun it at once - else we would not have been alive and blindly racing. I shudder to think of what a<br />shade of difference in his nervous reactions might have brought.<br />"South Station Under - Washington Under - Park Street Under-Kendall - Central - Harvard - " The<br />poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the Boston-Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through our<br />peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in New England, yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance<br />nor home feeling. It had only horror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, nefandous analogy that<br />had suggested it. We had expected, upon looking back, to see a terrible and incredible moving entity if<br />the mists were thin enough; but of that entity we had formed a clear idea. What we did see - for the mists<br />were indeed all too maliguly thinned - was something altogether different, and immeasurably more<br />hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective embodiment of the fantastic novelist&rsquo;s "thing that<br />should not be"; and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it<br />from a station platform - the great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterranean distance,<br />constellated with strangely colored lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder.<br />But we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as the nightmare, plastic column of<br />fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and<br />driving before it a spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss vapor. It was a terrible, indescribable thing<br />vaster than any subway train - a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and<br />with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the<br />tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening<br />floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still came that eldritch, mocking cry-<br />"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" and at last we remembered that the demoniac Shoggoths - given life, thought, and<br />plastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language save that which the dot groups<br />expressed - had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone masters.<br />XII<br />Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of threading our<br />back trail through the Cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream<br />fragments involving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion. It was as if we floated in a<br />nebulous world or dimension without time, causation, or orientation. The gray half-daylight of the vast<br />circular space sobered us somewhat; but we did not go near those cached sledges or look again at poor<br />Gedney and the dog. They have a strange and titanic mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will<br />find them still undisturbed.<br />It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath<br />which our race through the thin plateau air had produced; but not even fear of collapse could make us<br />pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky. There was something vaguely appropriate<br />about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot<br />cylinder of primal masonry, we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the<br />dead race&rsquo;s early and undecayed technique - a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years<br />ago.<br />Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks, with the<br />curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains<br />showing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east. The low antarctic sun of midnight peered<br />redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the terrible age and deadness of the<br />nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the<br />features of the polar landscape. The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous<br />ice-vapors, and the cold clutched at our vitals. Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had<br />instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling<br />climb down the mound and the walk through the aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our<br />aeroplane waited. Of what had set us fleeing from that darkness of earth&rsquo;s secret and archaic gulfs we<br />said nothing at all.<br />In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills-the probable ancient<br />terrace - by which we had descended, and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse<br />ruins on the rising slope ahead. Halfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing<br />spell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible stone shapes below us-once more<br />outlined mystically against an unknown west. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its<br />morning haziness; the restless ice-vapors having moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines<br />seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or<br />conclusive.<br />There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim, elfin line of<br />pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose color of the<br />western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the depressed course of the<br />bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow. For a second we gasped in admiration of the<br />scene&rsquo;s unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet<br />line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land - highest of earth&rsquo;s peaks and<br />focus of earth&rsquo;s evil; harborers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; shunned and prayed to by<br />those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living thing on earth, but visited by the sinister<br />lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night - beyond doubt the unknown<br />archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, whereof primal legends<br />hint evasively.<br />If the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly, these cryptic violet mountains<br />could not be much less than three hundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin<br />essence appear above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet<br />about to rise into unaccustomed heavens. Their height, then, must have been tremendous beyond all<br />comparison - carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled only by such gaseous wraiths as<br />rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously<br />of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their<br />accursed slopes - and wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those Old<br />Ones who carved them so reticently. I recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at<br />Queen Mary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson&rsquo;s expedition was doubtless<br />working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men<br />a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a measure of my<br />overwrought condition at the time - and Danforth seemed to be even worse.<br />Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane, our fears had become<br />transferred to the lesser but vast-enough range whose recrossing lay ahead of us. From these foothills the<br />black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those<br />strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the frightful amorphous entities that<br />might have pushed their fetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face<br />without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where the wind<br />made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make matters worse, we saw distinct<br />traces of local mist around several of the summits-as poor Lake must have done when he made that early<br />mistake about volcanism - and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped;<br />of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.<br />All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs. Danforth got the engine<br />started without trouble, and we made a very smooth take-off over the nightmare city. Below us the<br />primal Cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it, and we began rising and<br />turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must have been great<br />disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things; but at<br />twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As<br />we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind&rsquo;s strange piping again became manifest, and I could see<br />Danforth&rsquo;s hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur that I was, I thought at that moment that I might<br />be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles; and when I made<br />motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and<br />self-possession about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the<br />pass-resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and wishing that I had<br />wax-stopped ears like Ulysses&rsquo; men off the Siren&rsquo;s coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my<br />consciousness.<br />But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not keep<br />quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the<br />cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and<br />upward at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky. It was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through<br />the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and<br />causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment. A second afterward my resolution<br />triumphed and we made the crossing safely - yet I am afraid that Danforth will never be -the same again.<br />I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely-a horror<br />which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted<br />conversation above the wind&rsquo;s piping and the engine&rsquo;s buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range<br />and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we<br />had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people<br />to know and discuss lightly-and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that<br />Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and<br />safety of mankind, that some of earth&rsquo;s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest<br />sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash<br />out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.<br />All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares, anything<br />connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily-honeycombed mountains of<br />madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith clouds,<br />of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared.<br />It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed<br />through, and of the actual though unrecognized mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near<br />Lake&rsquo;s camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still.<br />He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about "The black pit," "the carven<br />rim," "the protoShoggoths," "the windowless solids with five dimensions," "the nameless cylinder," "the<br />elder Pharos," "Yog-Sothoth," "the primal white jelly," "the color out of space," "the wings," "the eyes in<br />darkness," "the moon-ladder," "the original, the eternal, the undying," and other bizarre conceptions; but<br />when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier<br />years. Danforth, indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that<br />worm-riddled copy of theNecronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library.<br />The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed enough; and although I did<br />not see the zenith, I can well imagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms. Imagination,<br />knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers<br />of restless cloud, might easily have supplied the rest - and, of course, Danforth did not hint any of these<br />specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never<br />have seen so much in one instantaneous glance.<br />At the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single, mad word of all too obvious source:<br />"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"</p>
