# LovecraftSite
A small (static) website i made in 2017 dedicated to Lovecraft.

This website is basically me practicing CSS and HTML (with a touch of JS) when i was in college, good taste notwithstanding It's 
"dedicated" to H.P Lovecraft, a horror writer famous for being "The father of Modern Horror". sorry for all the red.
